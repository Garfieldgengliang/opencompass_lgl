In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the conjunction "because," which suggests that it refers to the subject that preceded it, which is "the patient." Therefore, "he" is referring to the patient who had a rare skin condition. So the correct antecedent for "he" is:

(A) The patient had a skin condition

The answer is not (B) because the specialist is not the antecedent for "he" in this context, and there is no ambiguity about the reference, as the patient is clearly mentioned as the one with the skin condition. So the answer is (A).

Here we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he". The pronoun "he" could potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist, since both were mentioned in the previous clause. The sentence structure is: "The scientist collaborated with the artist, and (he) shared a story."

Considering the pronoun "he" follows the action of collaboration, which is typically associated with sharing information, it's more likely to refer to the person who would share a story after collaborating. Given that scientists often share stories, especially if they are collaborating with artists, it's reasonable to assume that "he" might refer to the scientist.

However, without further context, it's not absolutely certain. Therefore, the best answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

The pronoun "he" could potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist, and more context would be needed to definitively resolve the ambiguity.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "she" typically refers to a female subject, and in this context, it's clear that the subject using "big words" is the one causing difficulty in communication. The developer is the other person in the sentence, and it wouldn't make sense for the developer to use big words to communicate with themselves. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" must be the writer, who is the other party involved in the communication.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer uses big words

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the conjunction "and," which connects two independent clauses. The first clause is "The scientist will collaborate with the artist," and the second clause is "he will share a story." Since "he" comes right after the scientist, it is most likely that "he" refers to the scientist, as it would be the subject of the second clause that follows directly.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the scientist." So the correct answer is:

(A) The scientist will share a story.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent for "their" could be either Bailey's or the director's since both are singular nouns that can possess an office. The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine which one it is.

Therefore, the pronoun "their" is ambiguous, and the answer is (C). Without additional context, we cannot say whether it is Bailey's office or the director's office.
  2%|█▋                                                                                     | 5/250 [02:16<1:58:57, 29.13s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "she" refers back to. Here, there are two potential antecedents: "the developer" and "the designer." Since the verb "liked" is in the past tense, it implies an action performed by one of these two individuals. 

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the argument is related to liking the design. If "she" refers to the developer, then the argument would be because the developer liked the design, which is not a typical cause for an argument between them. On the other hand, if "she" refers to the designer, then the argument could make sense, as the designer might like their own design and be defending it against the developer's disagreement.

Given the context and the likely scenario of a designer defending their work, the most logical antecedent for "she" in this sentence is "the designer." Therefore, the answer is:

(B) The designer liked the design.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female subject, we need to look for a female subject in the previous clause that could be too late. The only female subject mentioned is "the witness," so the antecedent of "she" is most likely "the witness." Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The witness was too late.
  3%|██▍                                                                                    | 7/250 [03:19<2:03:35, 30.52s/it]================================================================================================================================
In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what or whom "them" refers to. The antecedent for "them" must be someone who could be asked to open the door. The sentence mentions two people: the guard and the cleaner. Since the verb "called" is typically used to involve two parties in a conversation, it's reasonable to assume that the guard is the one doing the calling and the cleaner is the one being addressed.

The verb "asked" is the action associated with the pronoun "them," and since the guard is the one doing the asking, it is logical to conclude that the pronoun "them" refers to the cleaner, as the cleaner is the one being asked to perform an action.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the cleaner
  3%|██▊                                                                                    | 8/250 [03:58<2:13:00, 32.98s/it]================================================================================================================================
The pronoun "he" in this sentence could potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist since the previous action "collaborates" involves both individuals. Without additional context to disambiguate, it is unclear whether "he" refers to the scientist continuing the action of sharing a story or if it's the artist doing so after collaboration. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.
  4%|███▏                                                                                   | 9/250 [04:19<1:57:19, 29.21s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "his" could potentially refer to either the customer or the chef since both are people and could have culinary training. The sentence structure does not provide enough context to definitively determine which person the pronoun is referring to. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. The correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  4%|███▍                                                                                  | 10/250 [04:38<1:44:53, 26.22s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun replaces or refers to. Here, "he" must refer to one of the two people mentioned: the mechanic or the cashier. The sentence structure indicates that the reason for the mechanic's dislike is the quality attributed to "he."

The sentence "The mechanic disliked the cashier because he is arrogant" implies that the characteristic of being arrogant is what caused the dislike. Since the pronoun "he" follows the verb "is" and describes a negative trait, it logically refers to the subject of the sentence that is receiving the description, which in this case is "the cashier."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The cashier is arrogant.
  4%|███▊                                                                                  | 11/250 [05:04<1:44:28, 26.23s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, "Bailey planned to meet the director at his office," the pronoun "his" is used to indicate possession. Since "his" typically refers to a male possessive pronoun, we need to consider whether it refers to Bailey or the director. 

If "his" refers to Bailey, the sentence would mean that Bailey plans to meet the director at Bailey's office. This is unlikely, as it's not common for someone to refer to their own office as "his" in this context.

If "his" refers to the director, the sentence would mean that Bailey plans to meet the director at the director's office, which is more plausible because people usually use "his" to indicate someone else's property or belongings.

Given the options, the most accurate interpretation of the sentence is that it is ambiguous because both possibilities exist, and without additional context, we cannot definitively determine whose office is meant. Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  5%|████▏                                                                                 | 12/250 [05:30<1:43:59, 26.22s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the subject of the verb "told," and it refers to the person who received the fake story. The antecedent of "them" must be the person mentioned just before it, which is "salesperson." Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the writer told the salesperson a fake story.

So the answer is (B) Told the salesperson a fake story. The antecedent is unambiguous in this case.
  5%|████▍                                                                                 | 13/250 [05:57<1:43:58, 26.32s/it]================================================================================================================================
The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support" refers to a shared possession or group. Since "the writer" is mentioned alongside "their friends," it is logical to assume that "their" refers to the writer's friends, as the writer would be the one requiring support to publish the story.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "their" is:

(A) They were the writer's friends

So, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "gave." Since "gave" is a verb that typically follows a direct object, the antecedent of "her" must be the noun that is receiving the action. In this case, "the housekeeper" is the one who could receive tips. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is "the housekeeper."

So the answer is (B) Gave the housekeeper some tips. The sentence structure indicates that the action of giving tips is directed towards the housekeeper, not the chief.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" refers to the subject of the verb "had purchased," which is typically understood to be the noun immediately preceding the pronoun. Here, that noun is "the house." So the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the house" and not "the homeowner" or "the inspector." Therefore, option (A) is the correct choice.

The sentence can be rephrased to make it clearer: "The homeowner asked the inspector if the house (that the homeowner had purchased) was structurally sound." This clarifies that the pronoun "they" refers to the homeowner, not the inspector.

So, the answer is:

(A) The homeowner had purchased
  6%|█████▌                                                                                | 16/250 [07:20<1:43:23, 26.51s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to connect back to a subject. We need to identify what "he" refers to since there are two potential antecedents: "the developer" and "the writer." The verb "focuses on code" provides context, but it's unclear whether it describes the person unable to communicate or the other person.

The sentence suggests that the inability to communicate is due to focusing on code, which is typically associated with the developer's role, as they are the ones responsible for coding. However, without additional information, it's not definitively clear if "he" refers to the developer or the writer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous, as it's not possible to definitively determine the antecedent based on the information provided.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer back to one of two possible antecedents: the supervisor or the employee. The key phrase to focus on is "stellar performance," which typically refers to the accomplishment or work being evaluated. Since the feedback is given by the supervisor to the employee, it's logical to assume that the "stellar performance" being referred to is that of the employee, as the supervisor would be providing feedback on their work.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "his" is the employee's performance. So the answer is (B).
  7%|██████▏                                                                               | 18/250 [08:12<1:41:04, 26.14s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to determine what it refers to, either the lawyer or the cashier. The antecedent for "he" should be the subject of the clause that follows "because." The clause is "he needed to understand the case." 

Since "he" comes after the clause explaining why the lawyer looked into the accusations, it is logical that "he" refers to the lawyer, who is the subject of the main clause. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the lawyer.

So the answer is (A) The lawyer needed to understand.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, "his" is a possessive pronoun, so it should refer to something that belongs to someone. The context suggests that the subject of the sentence, the mechanic, is the one doing the action (calling) and giving information about a car.

The sentence says, "The mechanic called to inform the customer that his car would be ready in the morning." Given that the mechanic is the one calling and giving the update, it is logical to assume that "his" refers to the mechanic's car, as the mechanic would be the one whose car needs work.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) It was the customer's car

So, the answer is (B), not (C) because the pronoun "his" does not refer to the mechanic's car, but rather the car that belongs to the customer, which the mechanic is informing about.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the verb "were repairing." We need to identify who is doing the repairing based on the context provided. The sentence starts with "The worker told," so it's logical to assume that the worker is the one doing the action. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" would be "the worker."

So the correct answer is (A) The worker was repairing. The pronoun "they" refers to the worker, not the pedestrian, since the worker is the one communicating the action to the pedestrian.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. We need to consider whether it refers to the taxpayer or the accountant. The sentence structure suggests that someone is looking for help, and the antecedent of "they" should logically be the person who needs help with tax preparation. 

Since the taxpayer is the one seeking assistance ("to find out if they could help"), it's more likely that "they" refers to the taxpayer in this context. However, without additional context, we cannot be absolutely certain. Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

The ambiguity lies in the fact that both the taxpayer and the accountant could potentially be asking for help from the other, but based on the sentence structure, the taxpayer is more likely to be the one needing help.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "liked" is the clue here, as it tells us what action the antecedent performed. The antecedent must be someone who could like a design. The sentence structure is "The developer argued with the designer because [he] liked the design." Since the developer is the one doing the arguing, it's more logical that the pronoun "he" refers to the developer.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the developer. So the correct answer is:

(A) The developer liked the design

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" appears after a clause that describes an action ("always teaching the assistant new techniques"). The pronoun "they" is typically used to refer back to the subject of the previous clause, which in this case is "the cook." Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "they" is "The cook," as it makes sense for the cook to enjoy teaching others.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The cook likes to teach

This means that the ambiguity in the sentence lies within the sentence structure, not in the antecedent, since it's clear that "they" refers to the cook. However, if the intended meaning was to imply that both the cook and the assistant like to teach, then the sentence would be ambiguous, but based on the given sentence, (A) is the correct interpretation.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the clause "because," which provides context for what the pronoun is referring to. The clause "because he is an expert on rare skin conditions" explains the reason for the referral. Since "he" is placed after "the specialist," it is most logical that "he" refers to the specialist, as the specialist is the one being described as an expert on rare skin conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The specialist is an expert.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to determine who "she" is referring to, either the technician or the customer. Since the verb "completed" typically implies the action of the subject, we can look at the context to decide.

The sentence structure is "The technician told the customer that _ had completed the repair." Here, "she" is used after the verb "had completed," which suggests that "she" is the subject of the completed action. Given that "the customer" is the direct recipient of the information, it is more likely that the pronoun "she" refers to the person being told the news, which is usually the subject of the action. Therefore, "she" is referring to the customer.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The customer completed the repair

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the person who received the prototype. The antecedent for "him" must be the person mentioned immediately before the pronoun, which is "the designer." Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the carpenter gave the prototype to the designer.

So the answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype. The sentence does not suggest that the carpenter received a prototype, making the antecedent unambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they." The pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the secretary or the developer based on the context. The clause "because they better understood the problem" suggests that the person who understands the problem better is the one who corrected the other person.

If "they" refers to the secretary (Option A), the sentence would mean: "The secretary corrected the developer because the secretary better understood the problem."

If "they" refers to the developer (Option B), the sentence would mean: "The secretary corrected the developer because the developer better understood the problem."

However, since the sentence implies that the secretary is correcting someone (the developer) due to a superior understanding of the problem, it's more logical to assume that "they" refers to the secretary. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is the secretary.

So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the key to determining its antecedent. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the undergraduate applying to work with the scientist is because of a need for a lab assistant. The antecedent of "he" must be the person who needs the assistant, which is typically the subject performing the action. Since the undergraduate is the subject who is applying, it is logical that "he" refers to the undergraduate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The scientist needed an assistant

The undergraduate is applying to help the scientist, so it's not the undergraduate who needs an assistant, but rather the scientist. Thus, the pronoun "he" is ambiguous if we don't have additional context, but based on the sentence provided, the most appropriate interpretation is that the scientist is the one needing an assistant.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used to refer to the performance of someone. Since "their" can be used for both singular and plural subjects, we need to analyze if the sentence supports either the supervisor's or the employee's performance.

The sentence structure is: "The supervisor gave the employee feedback on [their] stellar performance." Here, "stellar performance" is likely to be attributed to the person receiving the feedback, which is the employee. Therefore, it makes more sense for "their" to refer to the employee's performance.

So the correct answer is:

(B) It was the employee's performance

The sentence does not provide enough information to clearly indicate that the supervisor had a stellar performance, so the antecedent of "their" is ambiguous without additional context. However, based on the typical usage, it is more logical to assume it refers to the employee.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what it is referring to since it could potentially refer to either the salesperson or the writer. The verb "sold" is the action, and its subject is the salesperson, who is trying to fool someone. The person being fooled and then bought something is typically the object of the verb "sold."

Given this context, the most logical antecedent for "them" is the person who is being fooled and is buying the garbage, which is the writer, not the salesperson. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that "them" refers to the writer.

So the answer is (B) Sold the writer some garbage.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he". The pronoun "he" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause or action. The subject of the first part of the sentence is "the driver," and the second part starts with "after he broke a window." Since "he" comes after the word "after," it logically refers to the person whose action comes immediately before it, which in this case is "broke a window."

The verb "broke" is in the past tense, so it must be referring to an action that occurred before the main clause, "The driver yelled at the tailor." Given that, the only option that fits is:

(B) The tailor broke a window

So the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the tailor." The answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is typically the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun is replacing or referring to. Here, "he" could potentially refer to either "the visitor" or "the teacher," depending on the context. The sentence structure is such that "he" is following a verb ("liked"), which suggests that the action is being attributed to the person being mentioned.

Option (A) states that the visitor liked the cake, and option (B) states that the teacher liked the cake. Without further context, we cannot definitively determine which one is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous. The pronoun "he" is ambiguous because it could refer to either the visitor or the teacher.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the conjunction "and". Since "she" typically refers to the person mentioned immediately before it, and "the scientist" is the subject immediately before "she", it is most likely that "she" refers to the scientist. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the scientist.

So the correct answer is:
(A) The scientist will share a story

This means option (B) is incorrect because the artist is not the antecedent of "she" in this context, and option (C) is incorrect because there is no ambiguity about the antecedent of "she" in this sentence.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is used after the action "asked." The verb "asked" is the key to understanding the antecedent, as it is the main action being performed. The antecedent for "him" must be the person who could receive feedback. Since the sentence states that the designer showed the blueprint and then asked for feedback, it is logical that the person being asked for feedback would be the cook, who is the recipient of the blueprint.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the cook. So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the cook

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer to a person. The antecedent could be either "my parent" or "the secretary," depending on the intended meaning. The sentence structure suggests that the parent is the one calling someone, and that someone is a secretary. So, it's likely that "his" refers to the parent's secretary, as the parent would have a secretary they could call.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "his" is "They were my parent's secretary" (Option A). The sentence does not provide enough context to determine if the secretary being referred to is another person's secretary, so there is no clear antecedent for "the secretary's secretary" (Option B). Hence, the answer is (A).

The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun "she" is likely to be referring to the person who would have to mop the floor if the child stepped on it. Since the janitor is the one doing the mopping in this context, it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the janitor. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the janitor.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The janitor would have to mop

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent, or the noun that the pronoun refers to, determines who is doing the focusing. Here, the context suggests that the pronoun "she" is referring to someone who is unable to communicate with the developer due to focusing on code. Since the developer is the subject of the first part of the sentence, it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the writer, as they are the other party involved in the communication issue.

So the antecedent of "she" is "The writer." Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The writer focuses on code.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent for "they" must be the subject of the previous clause that refers to someone working on the house. Since the sentence begins with "The carpenter told," it's logical to assume that "they" would be referring to the carpenter, as the carpenter is the one doing the action of working on the house.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" is the carpenter. So the answer is (A) The carpenter had been working on the house.

The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support" could potentially refer to either the writer's friends or the friends referred to collectively by "her friends." The context suggests that "her" refers to the writer, so "their" could either be referring to the writer's friends (since "her" comes before "friends") or the friends of the friends mentioned earlier.

Therefore, the antecedent is ambiguous, as it's unclear if "they" refers to the writer's friends or the friends of the writer's friends. So the correct answer is (D) Ambiguous.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "the physician," which suggests that "they" is most likely referring back to the physician, as the subject of the second clause. The verb "could borrow" is also associated with the subject that came before it, which is "the physician" in this case. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the physician.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked if the physician could borrow money

In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is used after the action of asking. Since "the cleaner" is the subject that performed the action of calling and asking, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "them" refers back to the person who was asked to do something. Therefore, in this context, "them" refers to "the guard."

So the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is "the guard," and the answer is (B). The sentence means that the cleaner asked the guard to open the door. There is no ambiguity here.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" must refer to someone who is doing the action of standing in front of the door, as that is the reason for greeting the receptionist. Since "he" is used after "the mechanic greets," it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the person who is performing the action of greeting, which is the mechanic. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the mechanic.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The mechanic is standing in front of the door.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used after the word "discuss," which implies that someone's grading policy is being discussed. The two possible antecedents for "his" are "the educator" and "the student," since each could potentially have a grading policy. However, the context of "meeting with a student" suggests that the student is more likely to be the one whose grading policy would be discussed. Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation is that the pronoun "his" refers to the student.

So the answer is (B) It was the student's grading policy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, "was too late." We need to identify what "he" refers to. The antecedent of "he" could be either the investigator or the witness, as both are people who could be late. However, the context suggests that "he" is likely referring to the person who was trying to interview the witness, which would be the investigator.

Therefore, the most appropriate antecedent for "he" is the investigator. So the answer is (A). The investigator was too late.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus of our analysis. We need to identify what "they" is referring to. Since "Alex" is mentioned as the subject of the sentence, it is natural to assume that "they" would refer back to Alex, as Alex is the one doing the action of telling and expressing their ability to meet or not.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is Alex. So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. We need to determine who needs to understand the case. The context suggests that the lawyer is looking into illegal accusations against the cashier, so the lawyer's actions are the focus.

The verb "needed" implies a motivation or purpose for the action. Since the lawyer is the one performing the investigation, it is logical that the pronoun "they" refers to the lawyer, as the lawyer is the subject of the sentence.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the lawyer, not the cashier. So the answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is typically the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun replaces. Here, "he" refers back to a male subject. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the nurse running is related to someone smelling awful. Since "the laborer" is the only male person mentioned in the sentence immediately preceding the pronoun "he," it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the laborer.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) The laborer smelled awful

So the answer is (B).

The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support" can be ambiguous, as it could potentially refer to either the writer or the writer's friends. We can analyze the options:

(A) If "they" refers to "the writer's friends," it would mean that the writer and their friends' support is necessary for publication.
(B) If "they" refers to "the friends' friends," it implies that the support of the friends of the friends is needed for publication.
(C) "They" cannot refer to the story's friends because a story does not have friends in this context.

Given the context, the most reasonable interpretation is that "they" refers to both the writer and their friends, as the writer is mentioned alongside "his friends." Therefore, the answer is (D) Ambiguous, because without additional context, it's unclear whether "his" modifies "writer" or "friends."

The pronoun "she" in the sentence "because she is standing in front of the door" must refer to a female subject. Since "the receptionist" is the only female person mentioned in the context provided (before the pronoun), it is clear that "she" refers to the receptionist.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "told" indicates that the subject is giving advice to someone else. The subject of the sentence is "the worker," so it is more logical that the advice is directed towards the person being addressed, which is "the pedestrian." Therefore, "she" refers to "the pedestrian."

The correct interpretation of the sentence is: "The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion of the street."

So the answer is (B). The antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the pedestrian."

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "met" suggests that someone is having a meeting, and "because" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship. Since "her" comes after "the designer," it is most likely referring to the designer's idea, as developers typically don't have ideas referred to as "hers." Therefore, the antecedent of "her" is the designer.

So the correct answer is (B) The designer's idea could be implemented.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to identify what "he" refers to. The antecedent of "he" should be the subject of the previous clause where "had been working" is the action.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "uphold the peace." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the clauses before the pronoun to see who could logically be performing the action of upholding the peace.

The first clause is "The sheriff protected the writer." Since the sheriff is a person capable of protecting someone, it is reasonable to assume that the sheriff is the one performing the action of protecting. Therefore, it makes sense that "they" would be referring to the sheriff, as the sheriff is the subject of the previous clause.

So, the correct antecedent for "they" is (A) The sheriff upholds the peace.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus of our analysis. We need to identify what "he" is referring to in the context of the sentence. The sentence structure suggests that "Alex" is doing the action of telling, and "he" follows the verb "could not meet." Therefore, the most logical antecedent for "he" in this context is the subject of the clause Alex is talking about, which is Alex himself.

So, the correct interpretation is that "he" refers to Alex. Thus, the answer is (A) Alex could not meet. The pronoun "we" is not a suitable antecedent because it would not make sense for Alex to say that "we" couldn't meet when the sentence is clearly about Alex's ability to meet. The sentence does not provide enough information to make "we" the antecedent, so the ambiguity is not present in this case.

Since the sentence states that the carpenter made a desk for the clerk and then "gave them a discount," it is logical that "them" refers to the clerk, as the clerk is the one receiving the discount. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(B) Gave the clerk a discount

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to refer back to one of the two nouns mentioned: "the mechanic" or "the cashier." Since the pronoun "they" is used after the conjunction "because," it is likely referring to the subject of the second clause, which is the noun that comes immediately before the conjunction. In this case, that noun is "the cashier." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the cashier."

So the correct answer is:
(B) The cashier is arrogant.

Here, we need to determine who the pronoun "she" is referring to in the sentence. The pronoun "she" can either be referring to the developer or the secretary, as both are female roles mentioned in the sentence. The verb "corrected" suggests that someone is providing an explanation or fixing an issue based on their understanding of the problem. Let's analyze both possibilities:

- If "she" refers to the developer: "The developer corrected the secretary because the developer better understood the problem." This means the developer had a better understanding than the secretary.
- If "she" refers to the secretary: "The developer corrected the secretary because the secretary better understood the problem." This would imply that the secretary had a better understanding than the developer, which seems less likely given the context of correction.

Given that the sentence implies that the reason for correction is due to superior understanding, it is more logical that the developer is the one with a better understanding, as they are the one correcting. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the developer.

Answer: (A) The developer understood the problem

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent of "her" can be either Bailey or the director, as "her" is a feminine pronoun and both are female characters in the sentence. The verb "planned" indicates an action performed by the subject of the sentence, which is usually understood to be the antecedent of the pronoun.

If "her" refers to Bailey, then the sentence would mean that Bailey planned to meet the director at Bailey's office. If "her" refers to the director, then it means Bailey planned to meet the director at the director's office.

Therefore, without additional context, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous, and the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after both "customer" and "chef," making it unclear which person's culinary training is being referred to. The correct answer is (C) Ambiguous. Without additional context or information, we cannot definitively determine whether "her" refers to the customer or the chef.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who is being described as an expert on rare skin conditions. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject that follows "because," which is "the specialist" in this case. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for referring the patient to the specialist is because the specialist has expertise.

So the correct answer is (B) The specialist is an expert.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both mentioned as individuals who will be discussing something. The pronoun "their" typically refers to both of these people when used together, since it implies a shared possession or experience. Therefore, when it comes to discussing "favorite dishes," the pronoun "their" could refer to either the reporter's dishes or the chef's dishes.

Since there's no clear indication which person's dishes are being referred to, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is ambiguous. The correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
 26%|██████████████████████▎                                                               | 65/250 [31:20<1:19:11, 25.69s/it]================================================================================================================================
The pronoun "she" in this sentence is ambiguous because it could refer to either the scientist or the artist. The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine who "she" is. Since there is no clear antecedent, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "because they used big words." To determine the antecedent, we need to look at the context and see which of the two possible subjects, "the developer" or "the writer," would logically use "big words" as the reason for communication difficulty.

If "they" refers to the developer, then the sentence would mean that the developer is the one using big words, making it difficult to communicate with the writer. This would contradict the initial statement that the developer was unable to communicate, as it would be the developer's fault for using big words.

If "they" refers to the writer, then the sentence makes sense: the writer is using big words, which makes it hard for the developer to understand and communicate.

Given the options, the most logical interpretation to avoid contradiction is that "they" refers to the writer, as it explains why the developer couldn't communicate. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is "the writer." So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. We have two possible subjects for "her": the pathologist and the victim. Since microscopes typically belong to the person conducting the examination, it's more logical for "her" to refer to the pathologist, who is the one using the microscope.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is the pathologist, which means the microscope belongs to the pathologist. So the answer is (A).

The pronoun "he" in the sentence "Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor" is ambiguous without additional context. The antecedent could be either Alex or Taylor, since the pronoun is referring to the subject of the previous clause. Here, "he" could be either:

1. If "he" refers to Alex: "Before Alex sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor." In this case, "he" would mean Alex, and the antecedent is (A) Alex sent the letter.

2. If "he" refers to Taylor: "Before Taylor sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor." In this case, "he" would mean Taylor, and the antecedent is (B) Taylor sent the letter.

Since the sentence does not provide enough information to unambiguously determine which person "he" refers to, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "disclosed" suggests that someone is sharing information, and since "he" comes after "the patient," it is most logical that "he" refers to the patient. Therefore, the patient is the one who had a history of substance abuse. The correct antecedent for "he" is "The patient."

So the answer is (A) The patient had a history. The sentence is not ambiguous in this context.

The pronoun "she" in this sentence is ambiguous because it could refer to either the scientist or the artist, as both are female gendered nouns. The sentence structure doesn't provide enough information to determine which one "she" refers to. Therefore, the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female person, and "the secretary" is the only female person mentioned in the context provided, the most logical interpretation is that "she" refers to the secretary. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "The secretary."

So the correct answer is:

(B) The secretary made a mistake

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is the key to determining the antecedent. The possible antecedents for "their" are "producers" because "producers" is the noun that could logically own an office. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the office referred to is the producers' office.

So the answer is (A) The office was the producers' office. The sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that it was Sam's office, so option (B) is incorrect, and the pronoun is unambiguous in this context, eliminating option (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the subject of the second verb "told". The antecedent of the pronoun "him" should be the noun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, the verb "told" is in the context of the writer trying to fool someone, and the person being fooled is typically the direct object of the verb "told". Since the writer is trying to fool the salesperson, it is logical that the writer is the one telling the fake story.

Therefore, the antecedent of "him" is "the salesperson," as the writer is the one telling the story. So the correct answer is:

(B) Told the salesperson a fake story.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what "them" refers to since there are two possible antecedents: "the carpenter" and "the designer." The verb "gave" suggests an action being done to the person mentioned after "them." Since the carpenter collaborated with the designer, it is reasonable to assume that the prototype would be given to both or either of them. Therefore, without additional context, the pronoun "them" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either.

The correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" appears after the verb "gave." To determine the antecedent, we look at the previous part of the sentence where there is an action that can logically be performed on someone. The antecedent for "him" must be the person who received the action. Here, "the carpenter made a desk for the clerk" implies that the carpenter is the one doing the action. So when the carpenter gives something, it would be logical to assume that "him" refers to the clerk, since the clerk is the recipient of the action.

Therefore, the antecedent of "him" is the clerk, and the correct option is:

(B) Gave the clerk a discount

The pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject of the clause that explains why the lawyer looked into the accusations. The antecedent is the person who needs to understand the case. The clause "because she needed to understand the case" suggests that the understanding is being sought for the purpose of the lawyer's actions.

Therefore, "she" refers to the lawyer, as the lawyer is the one performing the action of looking into the case and seeking understanding. So the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is (A) The lawyer needed to understand.

The answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "could pay," and it's crucial to determine whether it refers to the technician or the customer. The context suggests that the technician is giving instructions or information to the customer, so it's more likely that "they" would be referring to the person receiving the instruction, which is the customer in this case.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the customer, and the correct answer is (B). The customer could pay with cash.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the clause "because." To clarify the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the previous part of the sentence where the subject and action are related to the pronoun. The relevant part is "the librarian helped the CEO to find the book." Since "they" follows the helping action and is connected by "because," it logically refers to the person who requested help, which is typically the one needing assistance.

So, the antecedent of "they" in this context is "the CEO" because it is the one who asked for help. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The CEO asked

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" appears after the coordinating conjunction "and," which suggests that it is referring to the subject that comes before it. Since the two subjects are "the scientist" and "the artist," the antecedent of "they" could be either one.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to determine who "she" is referring to. The antecedent of "she" must be someone who could potentially need help. Since "the physician" is the subject immediately after the pronoun "she," it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the physician in this context.

So the correct interpretation is:

The assistant asked the physician if *the physician* needs any help.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the physician." The answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "needed to get more rest." The antecedent of the pronoun must be the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is referring to. The sentence structure suggests that the warning is being directed towards someone, which is why it's most logical that "they" refers to the patient, since the surgeon is the one giving the warning.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) The patient needed more rest

So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the surgeon or the nurse, since both are mentioned as people who could need more time. The verb "warned" suggests that someone is giving a cautionary statement to another person, but without additional context, it's not clear who the warning is directed towards. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The possible antecedents for "he" are the worker and the pedestrian, as they are both mentioned in the sentence. The verb "should avoid" is a clue to determine who the advice is directed towards.

The sentence structure suggests that the worker is the one giving advice, so it is likely that the pronoun "he" refers to the person receiving the advice, which is the pedestrian. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion

So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was in a good mood." We need to determine whose mood it is referring to. The antecedent for the pronoun "he" should be the subject of the previous clause, which is "The mechanic." Therefore, "he" refers to the mechanic.

So the correct antecedent for "he" is:

(A) The mechanic was in a good mood

Hence, the answer is (A). The pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure suggests that someone is asking a question to another person regarding their need for assistance. The verb "asked" is in the past tense, so we are looking for the subject who could have performed the action of asking. Here, the options are "assistant" and "physician."

The sentence structure follows the pattern "Subject asked the other person if they need help." Since "he" is a masculine pronoun, it typically refers to the person who is being addressed, which in this case is the recipient of the question. Given that the physician is the one being asked if they need help, the antecedent of "he" is "the physician."

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Asked if the physician needs help.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to in the sentence. The antecedent of "she" could be either the manager or the secretary, since "the manager" is the subject of the first part of the sentence and "the secretary" is the object of the message. The verb "didn't reply" indicates an action that follows the sending of the message, and without additional context, it's unclear whether "she" refers to the sender or the recipient.

Therefore, the pronoun "she" is ambiguous, and the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent of "they" should be the subject of the clause that explains why the practitioner made a house call.

In the sentence, "Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter," the pronoun "he" is ambiguous. The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun "he" could be referring to either Alex or Taylor, as both are capable of sending a letter. The antecedent of "he" depends on the intended meaning:

- If "he" refers to Alex, the sentence would mean that Alex didn't know Taylor until Alex (Alex himself) sent a letter, which is not logically consistent because Alex wouldn't need to send a letter to himself to learn about Taylor.
- If "he" refers to Taylor, the sentence would mean that Alex didn't know Taylor until Taylor sent a letter, which makes more sense, as Taylor could be the one introducing themselves through a letter.

Since the sentence does not provide enough context to determine the antecedent unambiguously, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "review" suggests that someone is looking at or examining something. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun, we need to find what "her" is referring to. The options given are "the student" and "the architect."

- If "her" refers to the student, then the blueprints would belong to the student, and the antecedent would be (A).
- If "her" refers to the architect, then the blueprints would belong to the architect, and the antecedent would be (B).

The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether "her" refers to the student or the architect, as it could be interpreted in either way depending on the context. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" refers to the possessor of the office. Since the previous action mentioned is "Sam went to his office," the pronoun must be referring to the person who owns or has a personal connection to the office. The antecedent for "his" in this context is Sam, as it is logical that Sam would go to an office that belongs to him.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The office was Sam's office.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the subject of the verb "told," and it refers to the person who received the communication. The sentence structure suggests that the construction worker is the one doing the action (calling) and sharing information (the whole story). Therefore, it is logical that "him" refers to the recipient of the call, which is the editor, not the construction worker. So the antecedent of "him" is the editor.

The correct answer is (B) Told the editor the story.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent for the pronoun "they." The verb "made" suggests that the subject of the action is doing the action of making a mistake. Since the pronoun "they" is used after "because," it is likely referring to the reason for the meeting between the developer and the secretary.

The sentence structure implies that the reason for the meeting was due to someone making a mistake. Given the options, the most logical antecedent for "they" is the person who caused the need for the meeting. In this context, it would make more sense for "they" to refer to the secretary, as the secretary is the one who is meeting with the developer because of a mistake.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the secretary. So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used, which can potentially refer to either the educator or the student. The verb "discuss" suggests that someone is sharing or talking about a policy, so it's unclear whether the policy being discussed is the educator's or the student's. Without additional context, we cannot definitively determine which person's policy it is. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

So the answer is (C).

The pronoun "her" in the sentence "After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office" could potentially refer to either Sam or the producers, depending on the context. However, based on common usage, when someone mentions going to their "office" after an event, it is usually understood that they are referring to their own personal office.

In this case, since "Sam" is the subject of the sentence and the action of going to the office comes after the meeting with the producers, it is most likely that "her" refers to Sam. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is Sam, not the producers. So the answer is (A) It is Sam's office. However, without additional context, there is a slight ambiguity, but given the typical interpretation, we choose Sam's office as the main referent.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to determine what it is referring to, either the nurse or the laborer. The clause "because she smelled awful" provides the reason for the action described in the first part of the sentence. Since "smelled awful" is a negative quality typically associated with someone, it's more logical that "she" would be describing the person being avoided, which in this context is the laborer, as the nurse is the one running.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the laborer. The correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" must refer to the person or group that received the blueprint from the designer. The antecedent of the pronoun "them" must be the noun or pronoun that the verb "gave" is connected to. Here, "gave" is connected to "them," which means the antecedent must be the direct object of the verb "gave." The sentence states that the designer collaborated with the carpenter, so it is logical to assume that the blueprint would be given to the carpenter since they are the ones mentioned in the context of receiving the blueprint.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is "the carpenter," so the correct answer is (B). The designer gave the blueprint to the carpenter.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second clause "was in a good mood." To clarify the antecedent, we need to look at the context provided by the first clause. The first clause is "The mechanic greets the receptionist," which suggests that the mechanic is performing an action (greeting) towards someone. Since the pronoun "she" follows this action and is typically used to refer to a person being greeted, it is most logical that "she" refers to the person being greeted, which in this case is the receptionist.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is:

(B) The receptionist was in a good mood.

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "wrote," which suggests that it is referring back to the subject that performed the action of writing. Since "the writer" is the subject immediately before the pronoun, it is clear that "they" refers to the writer. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "The writer."

So the correct answer is:
(B) The writer wrote a good book.

In the sentence, "Alex did not know Taylor until she sent a letter," the pronoun "she" is crucial to determine its antecedent. The verb "sent" is a clue to the subject of the action. Since "Alex did not know Taylor" before the event, the logical antecedent for "she" that would make sense in the context of introducing knowledge would be the person who initiated the action of sending a letter.

Given that "Taylor sent a letter," it is Taylor who performs the action of sending, which leads to Alex knowing her. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" in this context is Taylor. So the answer is:

(B) Taylor sent the letter

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context is that the taxpayer is meeting with the accountant for help with tax preparation. The pronoun "she" can potentially refer to either the taxpayer or the accountant, since both are female gendered nouns. However, the sentence structure suggests that the accountant is the one providing assistance, as "help" typically follows the subject who is offering the help.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "she" is the accountant, as it makes sense that the accountant could help with tax preparation. However, without additional context, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that "she" refers to the taxpayer, asking if they themselves could help. Hence, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, we need to identify whose idea is being referred to by the pronoun "their." The antecedent of "their" should be the subject of the clause immediately preceding it. The clause is "the designer's idea can be implemented," which suggests that the designer's idea is the one being discussed in the context of the meeting. Therefore, the antecedent of "their" is most likely the designer's idea.

So the answer is (B) The designer's idea could be implemented. The sentence implies that the reason for the developer meeting with the designer is because the designer's idea has potential for implementation.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" refers to the subject of the clause that precedes it. The clause is "the house ... was structurally sound," and "he" must be referring to the person who owns the house, since the context suggests the owner is concerned about its structural integrity. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is "the homeowner."

So the correct answer is:

(A) The homeowner had purchased

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "the physician". Since "the physician" is the subject of the clause "asked if", it is the most logical antecedent for the pronoun "they". The sentence structure suggests that the assistant is asking the physician about their need for help. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(B) Asked if the physician needs help

So the answer is (B). The antecedent of the pronoun "they" is clear in this context, and it refers to the physician, not the assistant.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the clause "because," which implies that it is providing additional information about the subject of the previous clause. The previous clause is "The mechanic disliked the cashier," so the pronoun "she" must be referring to the person who is disliked. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the person who is described as arrogant.

Since "she" is referring to the cashier, the correct answer is:

(B) The cashier is arrogant

There is no ambiguity here, as the pronoun clearly refers to the cashier, not the mechanic.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he." The pronoun "he" can potentially refer to either the developer or the secretary, based on the context provided. Let's consider both possibilities:

1. If "he" refers to the developer: "The developer met with the secretary because the developer made a mistake." This makes sense, as the developer is the one who committed the error, and therefore would have a reason to meet with the secretary.

2. If "he" refers to the secretary: "The developer met with the secretary because the secretary made a mistake." This would imply that the secretary, not the developer, made the mistake, which could be a reason for the meeting as well, but it's less common for a secretary to be the one making a mistake that requires a meeting with the developer.

Given the options, (A) and (B) are specific antecedents, but without additional context, it's ambiguous whether "he" refers to the developer or the secretary. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used to refer to the subject of the previous clause, which is the person receiving the information. The subject of the previous clause is "the customer," so the pronoun "their" should logically refer to the customer's possession.

In this sentence, "her" is the pronoun we need to clarify. Since "the reporter and the chef" are both singular nouns, the antecedent could be either one.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining its antecedent. We have two possible antecedents: "the designer" and "the carpenter." The verb "gave" is important here. If "her" refers to "the designer," it would mean that the designer gave a blueprint to themselves, which is unlikely. On the other hand, if "her" refers to "the carpenter," it makes sense, as the designer is giving the blueprint to the person they collaborated with.

Therefore, based on the context, the most likely antecedent for "her" is "the carpenter." So the answer is (B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint. The pronoun is not ambiguous in this case.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "asked". To determine the antecedent of "her," we need to see who could be the one being asked to clean the room. The antecedent for "her" must be a female, as "her" is a gendered pronoun. Here, the only female mentioned in the sentence is "janitor."

So, the correct interpretation of "her" is "the janitor." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is the person being asked, which is the janitor. The answer is (B) Asked the janitor.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We need to determine who the pronoun is referring to: the technician or the customer. Since the sentence states that the technician is communicating to the customer, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "he" refers to the subject performing the action, which in this context is the technician. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the technician.

So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second part of the clause after "that". To determine its antecedent, we look at the previous clause, where "the visitor" is the subject. Since "he" is used in the context of a direct speech, it's most likely referring to the person who is speaking, which in this case is "the visitor." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the visitor."

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to determine what "they" is referring to since it could potentially refer to either the paralegal or the client. The context clues are "forgot to file paperwork" and "fired." If "they" refers to the paralegal, it would mean the paralegal was fired for the reason provided. If "they" refers to the client, it would suggest the client was fired because the paralegal's failure to file paperwork had negative consequences.

However, without further context, it's not clear whether the firing was a direct result of the paralegal's action or if the client was fired due to unrelated reasons. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "asked." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the context and see who would logically ask for a tool. The sentence states that the laborer handed the secretary a hammer, which implies that the action of asking for a tool occurred before this event.

If "they" refers to the laborer (Option A), the sentence would say, "The laborer handed the secretary a hammer because the laborer asked for a tool." However, this doesn't make sense, as the laborer is the one handing the tool, not asking for one.

If "they" refers to the secretary (Option B), the sentence would say, "The laborer handed the secretary a hammer because the secretary asked for a tool." This makes more sense, as the laborer is responding to the secretary's request.

Since the sentence structure doesn't clearly indicate who asked for the tool, the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "warned" suggests that the speaker is communicating something that might affect the person being warned. Given the context, the pronoun "she" is most likely referring to the person who is receiving the warning, which is the nurse in this case. Therefore, the antecedent for "she" is the nurse.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The nurse needed more time

The sentence implies that the surgeon is telling the nurse that the nurse (not the surgeon) requires additional time to prepare. Hence, the pronoun "she" refers to the nurse, making the antecedent unambiguous.

In the given sentence, "The physician told the baker that he had cancer," the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "told" suggests that the subject of the first clause (the one containing "that") is telling the information to the second clause's subject (the baker). Since "he" is the pronoun after "that," it is most logically referring to the subject of the first clause, which is "the physician."

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is the physician. So the answer is:

(B) The baker had cancer

However, this interpretation is incorrect because the verb "had" indicates a past condition, and it wouldn't make sense for the physician to have cancer if they were the one telling the baker about their own condition. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that "he" refers to the baker, as the one receiving the potentially shocking news. So the correct answer is actually:

(B) The baker had cancer

This is an error in the options provided, as the correct answer should be (B) and not (C) for this specific sentence.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure suggests that "they" is referring to the subject who disclosed something. Since "the patient disclosed" is the action part of the sentence, it is logical that "they" refers to the patient, who is the one doing the disclosing.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" is "the patient." So the answer is (A). The counselor is not the antecedent because they are the recipient of the disclosure, not the one with the history.

Answer: (A) The patient had a history

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "helped" is the action performed by the subject, which is the secretary. The prepositional phrase "to book a flight" indicates the purpose of the help. Since "her" is typically used to refer to the person just mentioned before it (in this case, the analyst), the most logical interpretation is that the secretary helped the analyst book a flight.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is the analyst, making the answer (B). The sentence means that the secretary helped the analyst, not the secretary themselves, book a flight.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the action, and the pronoun "her" indicates who was being asked to do something. The subject of the verb "called" is "the cleaner," and it is this person who typically performs the action of asking someone else. Therefore, the cleaner is the one asking, and the pronoun "her" refers to the guard.

So the correct antecedent for the pronoun "her" is "the guard." The answer is (B).

In the given sentence, "The physician told the baker that they had cancer," the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "told" suggests that the subject is doing the action of communicating the information. Since the physician is the one telling the information, it is more likely that the pronoun "they" refers to the physician, who is the one with the cancer.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The physician had cancer.

So, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "called," and it needs to be determined whether it refers to the cousin or the boss. Since the cousin is the subject of the sentence and the action of calling is performed by the cousin, it is logical that "they" refers to the person who made the call, which is the cousin.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "they" is "My cousin." This means option (A) is the correct interpretation: "They were my cousin's boss." This is because the cousin is calling their boss for more information, not the boss's boss. The pronoun "they" in this context is unambiguous.

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to identifying the antecedent. Since "they" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause, we need to look at the subject of the sentence "The engineer informed the client." The engineer is the one doing the informing, so it's logical that "they" would refer to the engineer.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" is the client, as the engineer is informing the client about the action needed. So the answer is:

(B) The client should make payments

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to identify what "they" refers to, either the nurse or the laborer. The sentence states that the nurse stayed away from the laborer due to a reason. The reason given is "because they were very busy."

If "they" refers to the nurse, the sentence would read: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because the nurse was very busy." This doesn't make logical sense, as the nurse wouldn't typically stay away from another person because they are busy.

If "they" refers to the laborer, the sentence would read: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because the laborer was very busy." This makes more sense, as the nurse could stay away if the laborer is busy.

Since the sentence can logically be interpreted as either the nurse or the laborer being busy, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context clues come from the verb "applied" and the reason given for doing so, which is "because she needed a lab assistant." Since the undergraduate is the one applying, it is logical that "she" refers to the undergraduate in this context, as the undergraduate is the one seeking the position of a lab assistant.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is the undergraduate. So the answer is (A) The undergraduate needed an assistant. The sentence does not imply that the scientist needs an assistant, only that the undergraduate's need for an assistant was the motivation for applying. Hence, there is no ambiguity here.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second clause "was repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible." To determine the antecedent, we look at the noun phrases that could logically precede such a pronoun. Here, the two potential antecedents are "the worker" and "the pedestrian." Since the verb "repairing" is in the present continuous tense, it implies an ongoing action. 

The sentence structure suggests that the person doing the action is the one who is communicating the intention or progress to the other person. Given that "the worker" is more likely to be the one doing the repair work, it makes sense that "she" would refer to the worker.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the worker," so the correct answer is:

(A) The worker was repairing

In the given sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the main action, and it's followed by a clause with "if" introducing a question. The subject of this clause is "he," which must be referring to one of the two people mentioned before it: "the assistant" or "the physician."

The sentence structure suggests that the assistant is asking a question, so it's logical that "he" would be asking the physician something. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is "the physician." The correct interpretation is:

(B) Asked if the physician could borrow money

So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "protected" suggests an action taken by someone towards another person, so the pronoun "she" is likely referring to the subject who performed the action. Since "the writer" is the other person mentioned in the sentence, and the action of protecting aligns better with the sheriff protecting the writer, the antecedent of "she" is most likely "the writer."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The writer upholds the peace.

As we did in the previous examples, we need to determine who the pronoun "he" is referring to in this sentence. Here, "he" could potentially refer to either the chief or the counselor, as both are mentioned in the context. The sentence structure is: "The chief told the counselor that [he] took the day off."

If "he" refers to the chief, the sentence would mean: "The chief told the counselor that the chief took the day off."
If "he" refers to the counselor, the sentence would mean: "The chief told the counselor that the counselor took the day off."

Since the pronoun "he" can be interpreted to refer to either party, the antecedent is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the key to determining the antecedent. The sentence structure indicates that "the secretary" is performing an action (helping) on someone else. Since "him" follows "analyst's office," it is most logical that "him" refers to the person whose office the secretary has come to, which is the analyst. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the secretary is helping the analyst.

So the answer is (B) Helped the analyst book a flight.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent, which the pronoun refers to, must be determined based on the context. Since "she" typically refers to a female, the most likely antecedent for "she" in this situation is the person being addressed by the technician, who is usually the customer, given that technicians generally interact with customers. Therefore, the correct antecedent is the customer.

So the answer is (B) The customer could pay.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to determine who it refers to. The antecedents are "the janitor" and "the child," and the verb "would have to mop" suggests an action related to the task of mopping.

The clause "otherwise he would have to mop it all over again" can be interpreted in two ways:

1. If "he" refers to "the janitor," it means that if the child doesn't listen to the warning, the janitor would have to mop the floor again.
2. If "he" refers to "the child," it implies that the child themselves would have to mop the floor if they stepped on the wet part.

Since both the janitor and the child could potentially be the one mopping the floor, the pronoun "he" is ambiguous in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject of the previous clause that provides context for the pronoun. The clause "The nurse stayed away from the laborer" has two possible subjects: "the nurse" and "the laborer." However, since the verb "was" suggests a personal state or characteristic, it's more logical that "she" refers to the subject who is described as being busy, which is typically the nurse. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is "the nurse."

So the correct answer is:
(A) The nurse was busy

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to understanding its antecedent. The verb "warned" suggests that the subject is giving advice or information to someone else. The antecedent of "she" must be the person receiving the warning, which is the patient, not the surgeon. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the patient needs more rest.

So the answer is (B). The patient needed more rest. The sentence does not imply that the surgeon needs rest, and there is no ambiguity regarding the antecedent of "she" in this context.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both singular nouns that could potentially be the antecedent of the pronoun "his."

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure indicates that the hygienist is communicating advice to the patient.

Therefore, the answer is (B) The patient should floss.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "informed" suggests that someone is giving information to another person. The subject of the sentence is "the engineer," and since the pronoun "she" follows, it is most likely referring back to the subject who is providing the information. Therefore, "she" is referring to the person who would need to make the payments.

So the correct antecedent for "she" is "the client," as the engineer is informing the client about their responsibility. Thus, the answer is (B) The client should make payments.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "because they focus on code." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the previous clause which contains the subject doing the action. The previous clause is "The developer was unable to communicate with the writer." Since "they" comes after "the developer," it is logical to assume that "they" refers to the developer, as the developer is the one performing the action of focusing on code.

So the correct antecedent is (A) The developer focuses on code.

Answer: (A)

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" is the person being addressed by the verb "asked." Since the verb "asked" is directed towards the physician, it's logical to assume that the pronoun "she" is referring to the physician. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the assistant is asking the physician if _she_ (the physician) could borrow some money.

So, the answer is (B) Asked if the physician could borrow money. The ambiguity here is resolved by the context, which makes it clear that "she" refers to the physician.

In this sentence, we need to identify what "their" refers to since it can be either the student's or the architect's blueprints. The antecedent for "their" should be determined based on the context provided by the action of setting up a meeting to review blueprints.

The sentence suggests that the student is taking the initiative to meet with the architect, which implies that the student is likely the one seeking review or has an interest in the blueprints. Therefore, it is more reasonable to assume that "their" refers to the blueprints that the student is bringing or discussing with the architect.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) The blueprints were the architect's

However, without additional context, it could also be argued that the student is reviewing the architect's blueprints for a project they're working on together. In this case, the ambiguity would persist. If the sentence specifies that the student is reviewing the architect's work, then (B) would be the correct answer. Since there is no clear indication, we'll choose the most plausible interpretation and select (B).

In the given sentence, "The physician told the baker that she had cancer," the pronoun "she" is the key element to determine its antecedent. The antecedent of "she" must be the subject of the clause where the pronoun is used, which is "had cancer." Since "she" is a female pronoun, it is clear that it must be referring to the person who is receiving the information about having cancer. In this context, that person is the one being told, which is typically the listener in a conversation. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the baker, as the physician is the one doing the telling.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The baker had cancer

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent of "her" must be a female person, since "her" is used as a possessive pronoun to indicate ownership. The possible antecedents are "parent" and "secretary," but since "parent" is a singular noun and typically wouldn't have a female secretary (as secretaries are usually associated with individuals), the most likely antecedent for "her" in this context is the secretary.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the secretary is being referred to as the one being called. So the answer is:

(A) They were my parent's secretary

This eliminates the possibility of "They were the secretary's secretary" because it suggests that the secretary has their own secretary, which is less likely in this context. The sentence is not ambiguous in terms of the gender of the secretary, so the answer is not (C).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after the verb "asked." To determine the antecedent of "her," we look at the two possible referents just before the pronoun, which are "the guard" and "the cleaner." The verb "called" suggests that someone initiated a communication, and "asked" implies a request. Since "her" typically refers to a female, it is more logical that the pronoun would refer to the person being addressed, which is usually the recipient of the request. In this case, "the cleaner" is the one being asked to perform an action, so "her" would refer to the cleaner.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "because he used big words." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who would logically use big words in the context of not being able to communicate with someone else.

The antecedent of "he" must be someone who could potentially use big words and cause difficulty in communication. Since "the developer" is mentioned before "he," it's more likely that "he" refers to the developer, as the reason for the communication issue is generally attributed to the person causing the problem.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The developer uses big words.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used, and we need to determine what it refers to. The antecedents for "their" could be either the pathologist or the victim. However, since a pathologist typically uses a microscope in their work, it's more logical for "their" to refer to the pathologist.

- If "they" refers to the manager, the sentence would mean: "The manager sent a message to the secretary, but the manager didn't reply yet," which is less likely since the manager would typically be the one sending the message.

Since both the manager and the secretary can be the antecedent of "they," the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

However, if the warning is meant for the janitor, who is responsible for mopping the floor, the correct interpretation would be that if the janitor has to mop it again due to the child's action, "they" (the janitor) would have to do it. In this case, the antecedent is (A) The janitor.

Since the sentence is ambiguous without additional context, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In the sentence "The manager asked the employee to not forget her car," the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "her" typically refers to the female noun that precedes it, which in this case is "employee." Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is the employee.

So the answer is:

(B) It was the employee's car

This is because the manager is asking the employee to remember their own car, not the manager's car.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both singular nouns, and "his" is a singular possessive pronoun. The pronoun "his" could potentially refer to either the reporter or the chef, as neither is specified as the owner of the favorite dishes. Therefore, without additional context, it's ambiguous who "his" refers to.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the clause that follows it, "had purchased." The antecedent of the pronoun "she" must be the noun that precedes it and is logically connected to the action. Here, "the homeowner" is the only noun that fits this description, as the homeowner is the one who would have purchased the house. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is "the homeowner."

So the correct answer is:

(A) The homeowner had purchased

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the conjunction "because," which suggests it is providing a reason for the action of correcting. Since "she" follows "the secretary," it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the secretary, as the secretary is the one performing the action of correcting. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the secretary."

So the correct answer is:

(A) The secretary understood the problem

This means that the secretary had a better understanding of the problem than the developer, which is why she corrected the developer. The pronoun "she" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the secretary.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was fired." We need to determine what entity is most logically connected to being fired based on the information provided in the first clause. The first clause states that "the paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client," which implies that the paralegal is the one responsible for the action leading to the consequence mentioned in the second clause.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is most likely the paralegal, as it is the person who could be fired for forgetting to file paperwork. So the correct answer is (A) The paralegal was fired. There is no ambiguity in this case.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure is: "The hygienist told the patient that _ should floss every day." The subject of the sentence is "the hygienist," who is telling the patient something. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "they" is referring to the person being advised, which is the patient.

So, the correct antecedent for "they" is the patient. The correct answer is (B) The patient should floss. The pronoun "they" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the patient.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "broke" suggests an action, and "she" is the subject typically associated with breaking something. Given that "she" comes after the verb "broke," it logically refers to the subject that precedes it. In this case, "the tailor" is the subject mentioned just before "she," so the antecedent of "she" is "the tailor."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The tailor broke a window.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to identify what "she" is referring to. The antecedent for "she" should be the subject of the verb "could not meet." Since "Alex tells us" is the main clause, and "she" is part of the subordinate clause, "she" must be referring to the subject of the subordinate clause, which is "Alex." Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is "Alex."

So the correct answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "gave" is the main action, and "her" is the indirect object of that action. The antecedent of "her" should be the person who receives the action of giving. The possible antecedents for "her" are "the carpenter" and "the clerk." However, since the sentence states that the carpenter made the desk for the clerk, it is more logical that the clerk would be the one receiving the discount, not the carpenter.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" in this context is "the clerk." So the answer is:

(B) Gave the clerk a discount

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" refers to the person the construction worker is communicating with. The verb "called" indicates that the action of calling is directed towards someone, and the verb "told" follows, implying that the story is being shared with that person. Since the construction worker is the one doing the calling and telling, it is logical that "them" refers to the person on the receiving end of the call, which is the editor.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is the editor, and the correct answer is (B). The construction worker told the story to the editor. There is no ambiguity here.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used, and we need to determine what it refers to. The antecedent could be either "my cousin" or "the boss" since both are male and could potentially call someone else's boss. However, the context suggests that the cousin is seeking information, which implies that the boss being referred to is the person who would provide that information. Therefore, it is most likely that "his" refers to the boss, not the cousin's boss.

So the correct interpretation is that "they" refers to the boss, making option (A) "They were my cousin's boss" the most appropriate choice. However, since there's a possibility that the pronoun could also refer to the boss's boss, the sentence is slightly ambiguous in this respect. But based on the direct action of calling for information, we can lean towards (A) as the primary antecedent.

Answer: (A) They were my cousin's boss (with a hint of ambiguity due to potential confusion with the boss's boss)

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the key to understanding the antecedent. The verb "sold" is the main action, and the subject of the sentence is "the salesperson." Since the salesperson is the one performing the action of selling, it is logical that "him" would refer to the person being sold something, which in this context is the writer, as they are the recipient of the sale.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is "the writer." So the correct answer is:

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

There is no ambiguity here since the context clearly indicates that "him" refers to the writer, not the salesperson.

In the given sentence, "The reporter and the chef discussed their favorite dishes," the pronoun "their" is used to refer to both the reporter and the chef. Since there are two individuals involved in the discussion, it's not clear whether "their" refers specifically to the reporter's dishes or the chef's dishes. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is ambiguous. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In the given sentence, "The customer and the chef discuss their culinary training," the pronoun "their" is used to refer to both the customer and the chef. Since both parties are involved in the discussion, the culinary training being referred to can be both the customer's and the chef's. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is not singular but rather shared between the two individuals. This makes the pronoun ambiguous because it could be referring to either person's culinary training.

So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the verb "needed," and it's important to identify which of the two possible antecedents, the CEO or the accountant, it refers to. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for buying the car is being provided, and "because" introduces a cause-and-effect relationship. Given that the CEO is the one performing the action (buying), it is logical to assume that the need for a car is associated with the person doing the action, which is the CEO.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" in this context is the CEO. So the answer is:

(A) The CEO needed a car

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "asked" suggests that someone is making a request, and the context of helping the CEO find a book indicates that the action is related to seeking the book. 

The pronoun "she" could logically refer to either the librarian or the CEO, as both are female gendered roles in the sentence. The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine which person asked. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either Bailey or the director. The antecedent depends on the context and whether the office is understood to belong to the person who is meeting or the person being met. Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whose office it is, the answer is (C) Ambiguous. Without additional context, it's unclear whether "their" refers to Bailey or the director.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to refer back to a subject that performed the action of asking. Since the verb "asked" is immediately after "because," it's reasonable to assume that "he" refers to the subject that performed the asking action, which is typically the person who initiates the request. In this context, the CEO is the one asking for the book, as the librarian is helping them find it in response to their request. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the CEO.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The CEO asked

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the person who receives the action of receiving the blueprint. The antecedent for "him" should be the person mentioned just before the pronoun. The sentence states that the designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave something to the carpenter. Therefore, "him" refers to the carpenter, as the designer is the one doing the giving.

So the correct antecedent is:

(B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint

Hence, the answer is (B). The pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, we need to identify who better understood the problem. The pronoun "they" is the key here. The verb "corrected" suggests that the person doing the correcting has a superior understanding of the problem. The antecedent for "they" could be either "developer" or "secretary," depending on the intended meaning.

If we assume "they" refers to the subject performing the action (correcting), then it would be the developer (since developers generally correct others). In this case, the antecedent is (A) The developer understood the problem.

However, if "they" refers to the person being corrected, then it would be the secretary, as the developer is the one doing the correction. In this case, the antecedent would be (B) The secretary understood the problem.

Since the sentence structure does not clearly specify which person is meant by "they," the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the verb "disclosed." The antecedent of "she" must be the subject that performed the action of disclosing. The subject in this case is "the patient," so the pronoun "she" refers back to the patient.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is the patient. So the answer is (A) The patient had a history. The sentence does not imply that the counselor had a history, making option (B) incorrect. The pronoun is unambiguous in this context, so there is no need to choose option (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to identify what it refers to. The antecedent of "she" must be a female noun or pronoun from the previous part of the sentence. The only potential antecedents are "the customer" and "the salesperson," both of which can be female. The sentence structure suggests that someone is asking for a favor, so it's logical to assume that the person making the request would be the one sending the prices.

Therefore, the most appropriate antecedent for "she" in this context is "the salesperson," as it's more common for a salesperson to send product prices in response to a customer's inquiry. So the answer is:

(B) The salesperson would send the prices

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "discussed" suggests that someone is sharing information about their culinary training. Since "her" is used after both "customer" and "chef," we need to consider both possibilities.

If "her" refers to the customer, then the sentence would mean: "The customer discussed the customer's culinary training." This would imply that the customer is sharing their own experience, which is plausible.

If "her" refers to the chef, then the sentence would mean: "The customer discussed the chef's culinary training." This would imply that the customer is asking about or commenting on the chef's background, which is also reasonable.

Since both interpretations are grammatically correct and could make sense in different contexts, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." We need to determine who "she" refers to since there are only two potential antecedents: the patient and the specialist. The verb "had" is the key here, as it indicates possession or occurrence of a condition. Since the reason for referring the patient to the specialist is given as "a rare skin condition," it makes logical sense that "she" refers to the patient, who is the one with the condition.

Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the patient, and the correct answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun, it typically refers to the noun that comes immediately before it, which is "student" in this case. Therefore, "her" is most likely referring to the student's grading policy.

So the correct antecedent for "her" is the student, and thus the answer is:

(B) It was the student's grading policy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to connect the reason for the referral. We need to determine whether "they" refers to the patient or the specialist. Since the sentence mentions that the patient was referred "because" of their expertise, it implies that the expertise is what led to the referral. Therefore, "they" is most likely referring to the patient, as the specialist's expertise is the reason for the referral.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The specialist is an expert

However, this answer is not among the given options. The closest option is (C) Ambiguous, which suggests there might be confusion, but in this case, the antecedent is clear based on the context. The correct interpretation is that "they" refers to the patient, so the answer should be clarified as follows:

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to. In this sentence, there are only two female characters mentioned: Bailey and the director. The antecedent for "her" must be one of these two. Since "Bailey" is a gender-neutral name, it could potentially refer to either Bailey or the director if it's used as a neutral pronoun. However, without further context or gender-specific information, we cannot definitively say whether "her" refers to Bailey or the director.

Therefore, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous in this sentence, and the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the focus. The antecedent of "her" is the person being fooled. The subject of the verb "told" is "the writer," and the object is "her," which refers to the salesperson. Therefore, the writer is the one telling a fake story to the salesperson.

So the correct antecedent for "her" is the salesperson, and the answer is (B). The sentence means that the writer intentionally deceived the salesperson by sharing a false story with her.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent for "he" must be the subject of the clause that comes before the pronoun. Here, "the engineer" is the subject that precedes "he," so the most logical antecedent for "he" is "the engineer." Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the engineer is the one who needs to make payments.

So the answer is (A) The engineer should make payments. The pronoun "he" refers to the engineer, not the client.

In this sentence, "their" is the pronoun we need to clarify. We have two potential antecedents: "parent" and "secretary." The sentence could be interpreted in two ways:

2. If "their" refers to "secretary," the sentence means "My parent called the secretary's secretary for more information" (option B).

Since "their" could logically refer to either the parent or the secretary, the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun "she" refers back to. Here, there are two possible antecedents: "visitor" and "teacher." The sentence structure suggests that "she" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, and since "likes the cake" is an action, it is more logical that the subject is performing the action.

The pronoun "she" can logically refer to either "the visitor" (since the visitor is the one doing the talking), so the sentence could be interpreted as:

"The visitor tells the teacher that the visitor likes the cake."

In this case, the antecedent of "she" is (A) The visitor.

However, without additional context, we cannot definitively rule out that "she" might also refer to "the teacher," especially if the teacher's reaction or preference for the cake is being discussed. Therefore, without more information, the pronoun is ambiguous.

So, the correct answer is:

If "his" refers to the developer, the sentence would mean that the developer's idea can be implemented, which is option (A).
If "his" refers to the designer, the sentence would mean that the designer's idea can be implemented, which is option (B).

Since the sentence does not clearly specify whose idea it is, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to understanding the antecedent. The verb "needed" suggests that the subject of needing a car is the person who receives the car. Since "the accountant" is the direct recipient of the gift (a car), it is logical to assume that "they" refers to the accountant in this context. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "The accountant."

So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine who "them" is referring to since there are two people mentioned: the secretary and the analyst. The verb "helped" suggests an action that is being done together, so we should consider both possibilities.

If "them" refers to the secretary, the sentence would mean the secretary helped the secretary book a flight, which doesn't make logical sense because a person wouldn't typically help themselves book a flight.

If "them" refers to the analyst, the sentence would mean the secretary helped the analyst book a flight, which is a reasonable action for a secretary assisting their colleague.

Given the context and the action of helping, it is most likely that "them" refers to the analyst. Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) Helped the analyst book a flight

So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining its antecedent. The antecedent of "her" must be the person the carpenter is giving a prototype to. Since the carpenter collaborated with the designer, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "her" refers to the designer, as they are the one who would receive the prototype in this context.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype. The sentence implies that the carpenter gave the prototype to the designer, not the carpenter themselves.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "needed more time to prepare." To determine the antecedent, we look at the previous clause, where the pronoun is introduced. The antecedent is typically the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing in the earlier part of the sentence.

Here, "he" is following "the surgeon warned the nurse," so the most logical antecedent for "he" is "the surgeon." The surgeon is the one who would need more time to prepare, as they are the ones performing the surgery.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) The surgeon needed more time

In the given sentence, "The manager asked the employee to not forget his car," the pronoun "his" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We must consider whether "his" refers to the manager or the employee.

- If "his" refers to the manager, the sentence would mean the manager is asking the employee to remember the manager's car, which is (A).
- If "his" refers to the employee, the sentence would mean the manager is asking the employee to remember the employee's car, which is (B).

Without additional context, it is ambiguous whether "his" refers to the manager or the employee. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, "My cousin called their boss for more information," the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either "my cousin" or "the boss." The sentence structure does not provide enough context to determine which one it is referring to. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure indicates that "he" is doing the action of writing a good book. Since "the writer" is the subject immediately before "he" and the verb "wrote" is in the past tense, it's logical to assume that "he" refers to "the writer." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the writer."

So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer wrote a good book.

In this sentence, "she" is the pronoun we need to clarify the antecedent for. The context suggests that "she" is doing an action (sending the letter) before another person (Alex) knows Taylor. Since the subject "she" comes after the action "sent the letter," it is more logical to assume that "she" is the one performing the action, not the recipient of the information.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "she" in this context is the person who sends the letter. So the correct interpretation is (A) Alex sent the letter, as Alex is the one whose knowledge is being mentioned in relation to Taylor.

The answer is (A).

In this sentence, we need to identify who the pronoun "they" refers to. Since "they" comes after the action of breaking a window ("broke a window"), the most logical antecedent for "they" would be the subject of that action. Between the driver and the tailor, only the tailor could break a window, as drivers typically don't break windows unless there's a specific context where they might. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that "they" refers to the tailor.

So the answer is (B) The tailor broke a window.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "understood" is a key clue to determine what "he" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that "because" introduces a reason for the action of "corrected." Therefore, it is likely that "he" is the person whose understanding of the problem led to the secretary correcting the developer.

Given the choices:
(A) The secretary understood the problem - This option doesn't fit the context, as the secretary is the one doing the correcting, not understanding.
(B) The developer understood the problem - This option makes sense, because the developer is the one being corrected, so it implies that they had a better understanding of the problem than the secretary.

Since the sentence implies that the developer's understanding is the reason for the correction, the correct answer is (B). The antecedent of "he" is "the developer."

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is clearly referring to the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is "the janitor." The verb "asked" is in the past tense and is directly followed by "him," indicating that the action of asking was directed towards the janitor. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the janitor, and the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to either the scientist or the artist, since both are working together. The verb "shared" could apply to either of them, depending on the context. Without additional context, it's not clear which one is meant. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, "her" is the pronoun we need to clarify. The antecedent, or the noun that the pronoun refers to, can be either the reporter or the chef since both are female. However, the context suggests that "her" is likely referring to the chef, as the chef is the one typically associated with discussing dishes. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that they are discussing the chef's favorite dishes.

So the answer is (B).
 81%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████                | 203/250 [1:43:41<23:06, 29.51s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. We can look at the context to determine who "they" could be referring to. The sentence suggests that someone was looking to do something (interview the witness) but failed to do so due to being too late. Since "they" immediately follows the action of wanting to interview, it is most likely referring to the subject who was trying to carry out the action, which in this case is the investigator.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" is:

(A) The investigator was too late

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." To determine the antecedent of "she," we need to look at the context preceding the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that "she" is referring to someone who likes to teach others. The part "The cook is always teaching the assistant" implies that the cook is performing the action of teaching. Therefore, the most logical antecedent for "she" is the cook, as it makes sense that the cook would be the one doing the teaching because they are the subject of the previous action.

So the correct answer is:
(A) The cook likes to teach

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female person, and the context suggests that the CEO bought the car for someone, it's reasonable to assume that "she" refers to the person who needed the car, which is usually the recipient of the action (buying a car). Therefore, in this case, "she" refers to the accountant.

So the correct antecedent for "she" is "The accountant needed a car."

Answer: (B) The accountant needed a car.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is ambiguous because it can refer to either the customer or the chef, depending on the context. The sentence doesn't provide enough information to determine which person's culinary training is being discussed. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous. Without additional context, we cannot definitively say whether "his" refers to the customer or the chef.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun that "she" refers back to. Since "the writer" is the only female noun in the sentence, the pronoun "she" must be referring to "the writer." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the writer." So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer wrote a good book.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining its antecedent. We have two possible antecedents for "his": the pathologist and the victim. Since a pathologist typically uses their own microscope for examining tissue samples, it is more logical that "his" refers to the pathologist's microscope.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) It was the pathologist's microscope

So, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is unambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "she" refers back to. Since "she" comes right after the subject "paralegal," it is most likely that "she" refers to the paralegal, as it makes sense in the context of the sentence: if the paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client, it could result in consequences for the paralegal, such as being fired.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the paralegal, and the correct answer is (A) The paralegal was fired. The sentence does not imply that the client was fired, so option (B) is incorrect, and since there's no ambiguity in this case, option (C) is also wrong.

The pronoun "they" in this sentence can potentially refer to either the mechanic or the receptionist, since both are mentioned in the context of standing in front of the door. The verb "greet" typically implies someone approaching or acknowledging another person, so it's reasonable to assume that the person doing the greeting is aware of the other person's position. Since the reason for the greeting is provided by "they are standing in front of the door," it's not clear whether "they" is specifically referring to the mechanic or the receptionist.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "could help with tax preparation." The antecedent of "he" should be the noun that the pronoun refers to. The possible antecedents are "the taxpayer" and "the accountant." The sentence structure suggests that the taxpayer is seeking help, so it is more likely that "he" refers to the accountant, who is the one being asked if they can provide assistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The accountant could help

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the conjunction "because," which indicates a cause-effect relationship. The antecedent of "they" should be the subject of the clause leading up to the conjunction. Here, that subject is "the patient," who is the one being referred to the specialist. Therefore, "they" refers to "the patient" in this context.

So the correct antecedent is (A) The patient had a skin condition.

Answer: (A)

In this case, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since the sentence structure is "Bailey plans to meet the director at [his] office," we need to see who the pronoun "his" could logically refer to. Given that "the director" is the person being mentioned just before the pronoun, it is most natural to assume that "his" refers to the director's office.

So the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is the director's office, making the correct answer (B). The sentence does not provide enough context to suggest that "his" refers to Bailey's office, as that would be less common in this context. Therefore, the ambiguity is resolved in favor of the director's office.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "could send the prices." The antecedent of "they" must be determined based on the context provided by the first part of the sentence, which is about the customer asking the salesperson something.

The sentence structure is: "The customer asked the salesperson if _ could send the prices."

Here, "they" is a pronoun that logically fits after "the salesperson," since the customer is asking a question to the salesperson. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the salesperson, who would be the one sending the prices if the customer's request is granted.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) The salesperson would send the prices

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the clause "The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques." The verb "likes" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, which follows the pronoun. Since "he" directly refers to the subject of the first part of the sentence, we can deduce that "he" is referring to the person doing the teaching. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "The cook."
