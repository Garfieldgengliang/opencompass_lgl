If today is 02/01/1987 in the UK format, which means February 1st, 1987, then a month ago would be January 1st, 1987 since January comes before February. In the standard US format (DD/MM/YYYY), this would be 01/01/1987. So the answer is (B).

If today is their 5-year anniversary, which means it's Jan 2, 1963 (since 1958 + 5 years = 1963), one week from today would be Jan 9, 1963. So the answer is (C) 01/09/1963.

If today is Tuesday, 7/9/1972, one week ago would be the previous Tuesday, which would be 7/2/1972. However, since we need to consider that there are only 7 days in a week, we actually move back 6 days from 7/9/1972 to get to the previous Tuesday, which is 7/4/1972. Since 7/4/1972 is not among the options, it seems there might be an error in the options provided or the context of the question. If we assume that the question means to find the date one week prior to the day before tomorrow, which would be the last Monday, we would subtract 7 days from 7/10/1972, which gives us 6/29/1972. However, none of the options match this date either. The best answer based on the given options would be (E) 07/01/1972, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The correct answer should be a date before 7/9/1972, but none of the options exactly fit that criteria.

Today's date is 10/16/1924. If the meeting is rescheduled for 11 am tomorrow, that means tomorrow's date is 10/17/1924. One week from tomorrow would be one week after 10/17/1924, which is 10/24/1924. However, since 10/24/1924 is not among the options, we need to consider that 10/24/1924 might be written as 10/22/1924 because some countries use a two-digit day format (where the first two digits represent the month and the last two digits represent the day), assuming it's a common practice in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 10/22/1924.

If Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, and this is her 5th visit today, then today's date is October 16, 2013 (since 4 visits have passed from October 2009 to October 2013). One year ago from today would be October 16, 2012. However, since we need the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we should adjust the year: 10/16/2012. This corresponds to option (A), but note that the options do not match the format. The closest option is (E) 01/26/2009, which is not correct as it is not in October. The correct answer should be the 16th of the previous month (September), since October is the 11th month, so one year earlier it would be September 16th, 2012. However, this date is not provided in the options. Given the options available, the best answer is (A) 08/16/2009, even though it is not the correct date due to the format difference.

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017. She ate one egg per day. To find out the date 24 hours later when she runs out of eggs, we need to calculate how many days it takes for her to eat 40 eggs.

40 eggs / 1 egg per day = 40 days

Since she started on May 9th, 40 days after May 9th would be:

May + 40 days = June 8th (since May has 31 days)

Now, 24 hours later would be June 9th. So, the date 24 hours later is June 9th, 2017, which is 06/09/2017.

However, none of the options provided matches this date exactly. The closest option is (C) 06/20/2017, which is not correct because it's not 24 hours later but rather 11 days later. The correct answer should be June 9th, so there might be an error in the options given. If the question is asking for the date 24 hours after she eats the last egg, which would be on June 8th, the answer would be June 9th, 2017, as well, but without a specific option for that, the best choice would be to assume it's an error and choose the closest available option, which is (C). But please note that this is based on the assumption that the options don't accurately represent the scenario described.

If the first day of 2019 was Tuesday, then the first Monday of 2019 is one week later, which would be January 7th, 2019 (since January 1st is Tuesday, 2nd is Wednesday, 3rd is Thursday, 4th is Friday, 5th is Saturday, 6th is Sunday, and 7th is Monday). One year ago from today would be January 7, 2018. So the answer is (B).

Today is Apr 10, 1985. Jane's appointment is 3 days later, so the appointment is on Apr 13, 1985. One week ago from Apr 13 would be Apr 6, 1985. However, since we need to express it in MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer would be 04/06/1985. None of the options provided matches this exact date, but option (D) is closest with 04/01/1985, which is one week earlier than Apr 10, 1985.

So the answer is (D).
  5%|████▏                                                                                 | 12/250 [05:37<1:45:17, 26.54s/it]================================================================================================================================
First, we need to find out the current date. Since Jane quit on Mar 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed, we add those days to March 20:

176 days from Mar 20 = Mar 20 + (176 days - 29 days [leap day adjustment]) = Mar 20 + 147 days
Mar 20 + 147 days = Oct 24, 2020

Now, we want to find the date one year ago from today. So, we subtract one year (365 days) from Oct 24, 2020:

Oct 24, 2020 - 365 days = Oct 24, 2019 (since there are no leap years between 2020 and 2019)

The date one year ago from today is Oct 24, 2019, which corresponds to (C) 10/24/2019.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

A palindrome day occurs when the month and day are the same in both the forward and backward order. Since today is the palindrome day of 2020, it must be a day like 02/02 or 12/12 or 02/22, etc. However, we're looking for a month ago, which means we go back one month. If today is February 2nd, then a month ago would be January 2nd, which would be 01/02/2020. Therefore, the answer is (B). Note that there isn't enough information to determine the exact day from the options given, but since the question asks for a month ago, we can assume it's the first day of the previous month, which is January 1st, not included in the options.

If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today is 11/11/2019. One week from today would be seven days after that, which is 11/18/2019. So the answer is (B).

The question states that the appointments are scheduled for tomorrow, which means we need to find the date that follows the current day, July 9, 1972. Since tomorrow is the next day after today, the correct answer is (D) 07/09/1972.

Therefore, the answer is:

D) 07/09/1972

If May 6, 1992 feels like yesterday to Jane, but that was actually ten years ago, we need to add ten years to that date. So, we go from 1992 to 2002. Since May 6 remains the same, today's date is May 6, 2002. Therefore, the answer is (E).
  7%|█████▊                                                                                | 17/250 [07:52<1:42:01, 26.27s/it]================================================================================================================================
Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year, we can calculate the number of days until the end of 2020:

365 days - 2020 days remaining in the year = 65 days left in 2020

Now, add those 65 days to the initial quitting date:

65 days + 2020 days = 2085 days

Now, we know that 176 days have already passed since March 20, 2020. So we subtract those 176 days:

2085 days - 176 days = 2009 days

Now we need to find the date that's 1 day after the remaining days:

2009 days + 1 day = 2010 days

Since we're looking for the date tomorrow, we add another day:

2010 days + 1 day = 2011 days

This is not a leap year, so February has 28 days, not 29. Therefore, the next leap year won't be until 2024. The closest date in the options is:

(A) 09/13/2020

So the answer is (A), but note that it's not an exact match because the actual date would be September 14th. However, since the options don't include 14th, 13th is the next best choice.

If today is Sep 9, 1909, then 10 days ago would be September 1, 1909. Since the day comes before the month in this format, the answer is (E) 08/02/1909 because 1st of September is one day before the 2nd of August.

If the current local time is 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004, then one year ago from today would be May 4, 2003, since we subtract one year from the same calendar day. So the date would be 05/04/2003. The answer is (E).

Since Jane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, today is 01/31/2012. Yesterday would be one day before that, so it's 01/30/2012. The answer is (D).

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, that means it's either December 31, 2014 (since there are 24 hours in a day), or January 1, 2015 (because 36 hours after December 31 would be January 1). Since we're looking for the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from either December 31 or January 1.

- If it's December 31, 2014, one week ago would be December 24, 2014 (since 7 days before New Year's Eve is Christmas Eve).
- If it's January 1, 2015, one week ago would be December 28, 2014 (since 7 days before New Year's Day is 7 days before the 1st).

The only option that matches one of these dates is (C) 12/22/2014, which could be December 24 if we consider it as 7 days before January 1 (since 22nd is 7 days before the 29th). However, it's more likely that the date one week ago is December 28, 2014, in which case the correct answer would be December 21, 2014 (since there are 7 days between 21st and 28th).

Unfortunately, none of the options provided exactly match the calculated date. If we assume that (C) is meant to represent December 24, 2014, then that would be the most appropriate choice given the information. So, the answer is (C) 12/22/2014.

If today is July 29, 2002, and we add one week to it, we will count 7 days forward. July has 31 days, so next week would be in August. One week from July 29th is August 5th, which is 08/05/2002. However, since options do not have an exact match for August 5th, the closest option that comes closest to one week later would be (A) 08/03/2002, as it is three days after July 29th, not counting the day itself.

Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed. First, we calculate the number of days until one week ago from today. Since there are 7 days in a week, we subtract 7 from the total days passed:

176 days - 7 days = 169 days

Now, we need to find out the date 169 days ago from March 20, 2020. Since March has 31 days, we go back to February:

- March 20 to March 31: 11 days
- April has 30 days, so 11 + 30 = 41 days
- May has 31 days, so 41 + 31 = 72 days
- June has 30 days, so 72 + 30 = 102 days
- July has 31 days, so 102 + 31 = 133 days
- August has 31 days, so 133 + 31 = 164 days
- We have 164 days in August, and 1 more day to reach 165 (the 16th), but since we're looking for 169 days, we add another 5 days to account for the next week.

So, 165 + 5 = 170 days. This lands us in September 170 days after March 20, which is September 14, 2020 (since September has 30 days, and 14th is 170 - 16).

One week ago from today would be 9 days before September 14, which is September 6, 2020. Therefore, the answer is (D) 09/06/2020.

Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month. Since this is her 5th visit, she would have visited the bookstore on the 16th day for 4 months before the current month (counting from October 2009). October had 16th, November, December, and January. So, we add 4 months to October 16:

- October: 16 (already passed)
- November: 16 (already passed)
- December: 16 (already passed)
- January: 16 (today)

So today is January 16th, 2010. The date is 01/16/2010. The correct answer is (D).

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and she ate one egg per day. To find out when she will run out, we subtract the number of eggs from the number of days in the week (7 days). 

40 eggs / 1 egg/day = 40 days

Now, we add 40 days to May 9th, 2017:

May 9 + 40 days = May 29, 2017 (since May has 31 days, we go to June)

One week from June 29, 2017 is July 6, 2017. So the date one week from today would be 07/06/2017.

However, among the options, there is no exact match for July 6, 2017. The closest option is (F) 07/25/2017, which is one week after July 18, 2017. Since we are looking for the date one week from today, which is June 29, 2017, not May 29, 2017, this answer is incorrect. The correct answer should be within the range of June 25 to June 31, 2017.

There seems to be an error in the provided options, as none of them accurately represent the date one week from June 29, 2017. If we had to choose the best approximation based on the logic, it would be (C) 06/24/2017, which is the day before June 25, 2017, but since it's not listed, we can't definitively select an answer from the given options.

In reality, the correct answer would be June 25, 2017, but since that's not provided, the most reasonable choice from the list would be (C) 06/24/2017, even though it's not quite accurate.

If tomorrow is July 9, 1972, then 10 days ago would be June 29, 1972, since we subtract 10 days from July 9. Since there are only 30 days in June, we go back to June 29th instead of June 28th. So the correct answer is (D) 06/14/1972 because 10 days before June 29, 1972 is June 19, 1972, which falls within June of that year. However, none of the options exactly match this date. But among the options, (D) is the closest as it is closest to June 29, 1972.

The first day of 2019 was Tuesday, so January 1st, 2019 was a Tuesday. Today is the first Monday, which means it's 6 days after January 1st because there are 7 days in a week.

Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020. Since 176 days have passed, we can calculate the number of days in each month (ignoring February, which has 28 or 29 days) to find out the approximate date.

- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days

176 days = 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 24 (since 2020 is not a leap year, we only count 24 days for the remaining days)
This adds up to 192 days. We need 4 more days to reach 176 days.

So, 192 + 4 = 196 days passed. That puts us at the end of September.

24 hours later means one day after September 30th.

The next day would be October 1st, so the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY is 10/01/2020. However, this is not an option, but we can see that the closest option is (D) 10/05/2020, which is 5 days later than our calculated date.

So, the answer is (D) 10/05/2020.

If May 6, 1992 feels like yesterday to Jane, that means she is remembering that date as if it happened recently. Since it was actually ten years ago, we go back ten years from 1992: 1992 - 10 = 1982. Now, we need to find tomorrow's date. If today is May 6, 1982, then tomorrow would be May 7, 1982, which is (E) 05/07/1982.

To find the current date, we need to add 176 days to March 20, 2020. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year (which 2020 is), we can use that as a reference for calculating the number of days in each month. 

Mar 20 + 176 days = 
Apr 19 (since we add 30 days for April, and 16 days more)
May 18 (30 days in May)
Jun 17 (30 days)
Jul 17 (31 days)
Aug 17 (31 days)
Sep 17 (30 days)

So, after adding up the days, we get to September 17, 2020. The answer is (E).

If Jane was born on the last day of February, that means she was born on 28th February. If today is her 16th birthday, we add 16 years to 2001 to find the current year: 2001 + 16 = 2017. Since today is her birthday, it's still February, but now it's the 28th because it's the last day. Adding 24 hours (one day) will make it the next day, which is March 1st.

If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and it is their golden wedding anniversary (50 years), then today's date is Jan 2, 2008. To find 10 days before their anniversary, we subtract 10 from the day and adjust for the month if necessary (since January has 31 days):

- Subtracting 10 days from 2 gives us 22 (since we don't go into February)
- Since we're still in January, the day remains 22

So, 10 days ago would be 01/22/2008. However, none of the provided options match this date exactly. The closest option is (A) 03/29/2008, which is not correct for this context. Since the golden wedding anniversary typically refers to 50 years, it's unlikely that it would be March 29th, as that would only be 47 years after the marriage. Therefore, there might be an error in the options given or the question itself. If the golden anniversary refers to 50 years from the first anniversary, then the correct date would be Jan 2, 2008, and the 10-day difference would be 01/12/2008, but that's not among the options either.

If today is a palindrome date in 2020, that means it's a date where the digits are the same when read forwards and backwards, such as 02/02/2020 or 12/12/2020. Since 2020 is not a leap year, February 29th does not exist, so we need to find another palindrome date. The next possible palindrome date after today would be 02/03/2020, since 02/02/2020 has already passed. Tomorrow would be one day after that, which would be 02/04/2020. So the answer is (B).

If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and today is their golden wedding anniversary (which is typically after 50 years), we can calculate the year as follows:

1958 + 50 = 1908

However, since the golden anniversary is usually celebrated after 50 years from the wedding, we need to find the year when they would have had their 50th anniversary. The leap year occurs every 4 years, so there could be an extra day in the calculation. 

Let's check the years:
- 1958 + 49 = 1907 (not a leap year)
- 1958 + 50 = 1908 (leap year, so 2/29/1908)
- 1958 + 51 = 1909 (not a leap year)
- 1958 + 52 = 1910 (not a leap year)

The first leap year after 1958 is 1960, which is 2 years later. So, their 50th anniversary would be in 1960.

Now, let's find out the date:
- If their wedding was on Jan 2, 1958, their 50th anniversary would be on Jan 2, 2010.

Yesterday would be January 1, 2010 (since 2010 is not a leap year, there's no February 29).

So the answer is (B) 01/01/2010. However, since this option isn't listed among the choices, it's possible there might be a mistake in the question or options provided. If the correct option is not among these, we cannot determine the exact date with the given information.

Jane was born on February 29, 2000 (since 2000 is a leap year with 29th February). If today is her 16th birthday, that means today is February 29, 2016. One year ago from today would be February 29, 2015 (since there is no 29th February in non-leap years). However, since we can't have February 29 in a non-leap year, we look for the closest day before or after. February 28, 2015, is the correct date one year before her birthday, as it's the last day of February. So the answer is (A) 02/28/2015.

Since Jane thought it was March 11, but it's actually March 12, 10 days ago would be March 2 (since 12 - 10 = 2). However, since we need to account for her incorrect initial assumption, we go back 10 days from March 2, 2002, which is February 23, 2002 (02/23/2002). So the answer is (B).

If the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933, yesterday would be 11/24/1933, and 24 hours later (which is one day) would be today, 11/25/1933. So the answer is (A).

If Jane booked her flight for tomorrow, which is July 29, 2002, 24 hours later would be July 30, 2002, since there are 24 hours in a day. So the answer is (C) 07/30/2002.

If Jane was born on February 29th (the last day of February) in 2000, and today is her 16th birthday, that means she was born in 2000 - 16 = 1984. Since 2000 is a leap year, February 29th exists. However, 1984 is not a leap year, so there is no February 29th. Therefore, we need to consider that her birthday would be on February 28th in non-leap years like 1984.

Since today is her 16th birthday, it must be February 28, 2016. Tomorrow will be March 1st, 2016. So the answer is (D).

If today is 4/19/1969, one week ago would be 4 days before that. Since there are 7 days in a week, we subtract 4 days from 19:

19 - 4 = 15

So, the date one week ago is 04/15/1969. None of the options exactly match this, but option (B) 04/12/1969 is the closest, as it's only two days before 15th. However, since we can't have a date earlier than the 1st of the month, the correct answer should be the day before 15th, which would be the 14th.

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed, but based on the reasoning, the closest valid answer would be (B) 04/12/1969.

Since Jane saw a meteor shower for the second time in 1973 on 3/5, this implies that she must have seen it for the first time on 2/5 of the same year, because there are 30 days in February and assuming she didn't see it on the same day a month earlier (January), which is less than 30 days away. Therefore, a month ago would be 02/05/1973. The answer is (A).

If a week ago was Sept. 1st, 2021, then today is Sept. 8th, 2021 (since one week after the 1st is the 8th). One week ago from today would be Sept. 1st, 2021, again, because the week would have completed a cycle. So the answer is (C) 09/01/2021.

If the deadline is 2 days away from now, that means today is May 30, 2021 (since June 1st is 2 days after May 30th). 10 days before May 30th would be May 20th, 2021. So the answer is (E).

Jane was born on February 28, 2001. Today is her 16th birthday, which means 16 years have passed since 2001. We add 16 years to 2001:

Since today is her birthday, it is February 28, 2017. So the correct answer is (F) 02/28/2017.

If May 6, 1992 feels like yesterday to Jane, that means it was yesterday for her, which would be May 5, 1992 (since we're counting backwards). Since this was ten years ago, we add ten years to the date: 1992 + 10 = 2002. So, yesterday for Jane would be May 5, 2002, in MM/DD/YYYY format. The correct answer is (F).

Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. If today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001, then today is November 22, 2001 (since November has 30 days, the fourth Thursday would be at least the 21st, and with 30 days in November, it would be the 22nd). A month ago from November 22, 2001, we go back to October 22, 2001. So the answer is (F).

If Jane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, today's date is 01/31/2012. One week from today would be 02/07/2012, as there are 7 days in a week. So the answer is (F).

If today is 9/7, and Jane is watching NFL 2003, that means it is at least September 7, 2003. One year ago from today would be September 7, 2002. So the answer is (C) 09/07/2002.

Based on these examples, we can infer that the date format MM/DD/YYYY is used, and we need to subtract one year from the given date to find the date one year ago.

The first quarter of a year has 90 days (3 months * 30 days per month). If today is the last day of the first quarter, it would be 30th of March (March 30th) in 2008. One week from today would be 7 days after March 30th, which is April 6th, 2008. So the answer is (F) 04/06/2008.

Jane started working on Dec 2, 2016. Three years after that would be December 2, 2019 (since we don't count the anniversary day itself). A month before December 2nd would be November 1st, so the date a month ago would be 11/01/2019. Therefore, the answer is (A).

If tomorrow is July 29, 2002, then a month ago would be June 29, 2002. However, since we can't have a 29th day in June (June has 30 days), we subtract one day to get June 28, 2002. So the correct answer is (E) 06/28/2002.

If Jane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, today's date is 31st January 2012. Since 24 hours later means the next calendar day, the date 24 hours later will be February 1st, 2012. Therefore, the answer is (F).

If Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, and it's Thanksgiving 2001 today, we need to determine which fourth Thursday it is. Since there are 30 days in October and 31 days in November, we can count back 30 days to find the 1st Thursday of November (because the fourth would be 7 days after that). So, November 1st is a Thursday, and 24 more days (including the 24-hour period we're looking for) would be November 24th.

Thus, 24 hours later would be the next day, which is November 25th, 2001. However, since we're asked for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we would write it as 11/25/2001. None of the options exactly match this, but option (B) comes closest, as it is 11/24/2002 (one day before the correct date). So, the best choice is (B) because it represents the day before the actual Thanksgiving day.

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and she ate one egg per day. To find out when she ran out of eggs, we subtract the number of eggs from the number of days:

40 eggs / 1 egg/day = 40 days

So, after 40 days, she would run out of eggs. Since May has 31 days, the next month with enough days would be June. 

May 9 + 40 days = June 8, 2017

Today is June 8, 2017, and we need to find yesterday's date. So, yesterday was June 7, 2017.

Therefore, the answer is (F) 06/25/2017 because June 7th is one day before June 8th.

If today is Apr 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment is 3 days later, we add 3 days to today's date. So, 10 + 3 = 13. The day part of the date remains the same since we're not crossing into the next month. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be Apr 13, 1985. The answer is (A).

Since it's Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, we know that the first occurrence was also in March (since meteor showers typically occur during the same period each year). If today is 3/5, and it's her second time, then the first time must have been on 3/5 as well. Therefore, 24 hours later will be 3/6, so the date is 03/06/1973. The answer is (A).

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017. If she eats one egg per day, we need to calculate how many days it would take for her to finish all 40 eggs.

40 eggs / 1 egg per day = 40 days

Now, add those 40 days to the initial purchase date:

May 9, 2017 + 40 days = June 28, 2017 (since May has 31 days, and June has 30 days)

Today is June 28, 2017. Tomorrow would be June 29, 2017.

So, the date tomorrow is 06/29/2017, which is not listed among the options. However, the closest option that comes close is (E) 06/21/2017, but it's not the correct date. The correct answer should be June 29th, but since there's no exact match, we can't choose from the given options.

The concert was initially scheduled for June 1st, but it was delayed by one day. Therefore, today's date is June 2nd, 1943. Tomorrow's date would be June 3rd, 1943. So the answer is (A) 06/03/1943.

If today is 9/7, and Jane is watching an event from NFL 2003, we don't have enough information to determine the exact date within 2003. However, since the options do not include a specific date within 2003, we can assume that the 10-day difference would still be within the same month (September). Therefore, 10 days before 9/7 would be 9/7 minus 10 days, which is 09/07/2003. So the answer is (C) 08/28/2003, assuming that the 10 days refers to a date within the same month and not a leap year adjustment.

However, without more context, it's impossible to definitively choose (C). If the question were asking for the date 10 days before September 7th in 2003, regardless of the day of the week, the answer would be (C) as well, because there's no other relevant information given.

If today is Apr 10, 1985, Jane's appointment will be 3 days later, which means her appointment is on Apr 13, 1985. One year before Apr 13, 1985, would be Apr 13, 1984. So the date one year ago from today is 04/13/1984, but since we're looking for the day before that (since April has 30 days), it would be Apr 12, 1984. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided, but if we have to choose the closest, it would be (D) 04/10/1984 (as it's the same day but one year earlier). However, none of the options exactly match the correct date.

Today is the 2nd of March, 1966. 24 hours later means we add one day to the current date. So, 2nd + 1 = 3rd. Since it's already the 2nd, adding another day will make it 03/03/1966. Therefore, the answer is (F).

Today is March 5th, and it's Jane's second time seeing a meteor shower in 1973. This implies that the first time must have been on February 26th (since February has 28 or 29 days), which is also a meteor shower day. One week ago from today would be one week before March 5th, which would be 2 weeks before the first meteor shower day. So, we subtract two weeks from February 26th:

- February 26 - 2 weeks = February 12

Since February 12, 1973, is a Monday (counting from February 26th, which is a Saturday), one week ago would be a week before that, which is a Friday:

- February 12 - 1 week = February 5

So, the date one week ago from today is February 5th, 1973, in the format MM/DD/YYYY, which is (E) 02/26/1973.

Given the context, the correct answer is (E).

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and she ate one egg per day. To find out when she would run out of eggs, we subtract the number of eggs from the number of days.

40 eggs / 1 egg/day = 40 days

Since she started on May 9th, we add 40 days to that date to find the last day she had an egg:

May 9th + 40 days = June 8th, 2017

Now, 10 days before that date would be:

June 8th - 10 days = May 28th, 2017

However, since May does not have a 31st day, May 28th must be May 29th (since we're counting from May 9th). Therefore, the correct answer should be May 29th, which corresponds to (E) 06/08/2017 because the day after May 29th is June 1st.

So, the answer is (E) 06/08/2017 with the understanding that the date 10 days ago from May 29th is actually June 8th, but the options only list the day of the month for May 29th.

Jane was born on February 28, 2001. Today is her 16th birthday, so today's date is February 28, 2017 (since we add 16 years to 2001). 10 days ago from February 28, 2017 would be February 18, 2017, since February has 28 days and we subtract 10 days. So the answer is (B) 02/18/2017.

Yesterday was April 30, 2021, so today is May 1, 2021. One week from today would be 7 days after May 1, which is May 8, 2021. So the answer is (F).

If Jane was born on the last day of February, that means she was born on 02/28/2001. Today is her 16th birthday, so today is 02/28/2017 + 16 years = 02/28/2033. One week from today would be one week after 03/07/2033 (since today is 03/07/2033), which is 03/14/2033. However, since 03/15/2033 is the next day after 03/14/2033, the correct answer is (F) 03/15/2033.

Therefore, the final answer is not among the options given, but the closest choice would be (F) as it represents one week from today in the year 2033. If the options were extended to include this date, the correct answer would be (F).

Today is actually Mar 13, 2002, which is 1 day after Jane thought it was 3/11/2002. Tomorrow would be one day after today, so it would be Mar 14, 2002, in MM/DD/YYYY format. Therefore, the answer is (A) 03/14/2002.

Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, so if it's the Thanksgiving of 2001, we need to find the fourth Thursday in November 2001. November 2001 has 30 days, so we count back four Thursdays from November 30th:

- November 30 - 7 days to November 23 (Thursday)
- November 23 - 7 days to November 16 (Thursday)
- November 16 - 7 days to November 9 (Thursday)
- November 9 - 7 days to November 2 (Thursday)

So, Thanksgiving 2001 was on November 22nd. Tomorrow would be November 23rd, 2001. The answer is (C).

If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and it's their golden wedding anniversary, that means they've been married for 50 years. So today's date is Jan 2, 2008 (50 years after 1958). One week ago from today would be Jan 2 - 7 days = Dec 26, 2007. Therefore, the answer is (A) 12/26/2007.

If today is Apr 10, 1985, Jane's appointment will be 3 days later, which means her appointment is on Apr 13, 1985. 10 days before Apr 13, 1985 is Apr 3, 1985. However, since we are looking for the date 10 days ago from today, we subtract those 10 days from today's date: 10 days before Apr 10, 1985 is Mar 30, 1985. The closest option is (F) 03/31/1985, but that would be the following day, not 10 days ago. The correct answer should be one day before that, so it's actually Mar 30, 1985 in MM/DD/YYYY format, which isn't listed among the options.

Given the options, the best approximation would be (F) 03/31/1985, but without an exact match, the answer is (E) 03/10/1986, as it is 10 days before Mar 31, 1985.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 03/10/1986.

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and she ate one egg per day. To find out when she ran out of eggs, we subtract the number of eggs from the number of days in a year (ignoring February for simplicity):

40 eggs / 1 egg per day = 40 days

Since May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 31 days, Jane will run out of eggs on:

May: 40 - 31 = 9 days left in May
June: 30 days
July: 31 days - 9 days (already counted) = 22 days

So, she runs out on July 22, 2017.

Now, to find the date one year ago from today, we go back to July 22, 2017:

- Subtract one year: July 22, 2017 - 1 year = July 22, 2016

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 07/22/2016, which corresponds to option (E).

Since today is the first Monday of 2019, it is 1/7 (Monday) of the year. One week from today will be the following Monday, which is 1+7=14 days after the start of the year.

Today is a palindrome day, so the date is of the form MM/DD/YYYY where MM is the same as DD. Since we know it's 2020, the only palindrome date in 2020 with two digits for both month and day would be 02/02/2020. 10 days before this date would be 01/23/2020 (since 02/02 - 10 days = 01/23).

If today is Christmas Eve (December 24), one week ago would be one week before December 24. Since there are 7 days in a week, we subtract 7 from 24:

If it was Sept. 1st, 2021 a week ago, that means 7 days before September 1st, 2021 is August 25th, 2021 (since September 1st minus 7 days equals August 25th). One year ago from August 25th, 2021 would be August 25th, 2020. So the date one year ago from today is 08/25/2020. The answer is (B).

Since we're looking for the date a month ago, we don't subtract another day, so the correct date would be March 31, 2021 (the last day of March). The answer is (D) 03/31/2021.

If today is Jane's second time seeing a meteor shower in 1973, that means she saw it once before. Since meteor showers can occur multiple times a year, but not necessarily on the same day each time, we can infer that the first occurrence must have been on February 28th (the last day of February). This is because if it were before that, there wouldn't be another opportunity to see it in March. Therefore, today, March 5th, is the first day of the second occurrence. So the date today in MM/DD/YYYY is 03/05/1973.

The correct answer is (E).

Given that today's meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, which means the meeting is happening on the next day after today.

Since Jane visits the bookstore every 16th of the month, we can calculate the number of 16ths in the months from October 2009 to the current month, which would be 5 visits. This means we've passed through October, November, December, January, and February (5 months). Each of these has 16 days, so we add 5 * 16 = 80 days.

Now, since today is the 16th, we need to add 5 days for her 5th visit (because today is included), which gives us 80 + 5 = 85 days. We need to find the date 7 days from today, which would be 85 + 7 = 92 days.

The first day of October 2009 was a Sunday (since there are 30 days in September and it's a leap year, so the 1st falls on a Sunday), so 92 days after that will be 12 days into March (since February has 29 days in a leap year). Therefore, one week from today is 1 week after the 24th of February, which is the 1st of March, 2010.

So the answer is (C) 03/01/2010.

If it was September 1st, 2021 a week ago, then 7 days before that would be August 25th, 2021. A month ago from September 1st would be July 31st, 2021, since September has 30 days. However, since we're looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we adjust the day to match the end of the month, which is 30th. So, the date a month ago would be 07/30/2021, but since there isn't an option for that, we choose the closest option that has the correct month, which is (F) 07/25/2021.

Answer: (F) 07/25/2021

Today is Apr 10, 1985. Jane's appointment is 3 days later, so the appointment date would be Apr 13, 1985. Yesterday would be one day before Apr 13, which is Apr 12, 1985. Since we are looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (C) 04/09/1985 because April 12 is the 9th day of April.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

If the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933, that means yesterday was 11/24/1933 and today is 11/25/1933. One week from today would be 11/25/1933 + 7 days = 12/01/1933. However, since we cannot have a day greater than 31, and 12/01/1933 is not an option, we need to adjust for a leap year (every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400). Since 1933 is not a leap year, there are only 31 days in November, so 11/25/1933 is the last day of the month. Therefore, one week from today would be the first day of December, which would be 12/01/1933. This date does not appear in the options provided, but since it is the correct calculation, the best possible answer is to choose the closest option, which is (E) 12/23/1933, even though it is not the correct date but the closest available option.

If Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, that means she was born on 02/28/2001. Today is her 16th birthday, which means today is 02/28/2017 (2001 + 16 years). One year ago from today would be 02/28/2016. So the answer is (C).

Based on these examples, the correct answers are:

If Jane was born on February 29th (the last day of February), and this is her 16-year-old birthday, that means she was born in 2000 (2000 + 16 = 2016). Since February 29th only occurs every four years, we need to find the last leap year before 2000. That would be 1996 (1996 + 16 = 2012). However, since we're looking for February 29th in 2016, we should consider the actual date, which would be March 1st (since February 29th is not valid for non-leap years). Therefore, yesterday would be February 28th, 2016. So the answer is (B).

If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and today is their golden wedding anniversary (50 years), then today's date is Jan 2, 2008. 24 hours later would be Jan 3, 2008. So the answer is (F) 01/03/2008.

However, since there is no golden wedding anniversary for the standard 50 years, I assume you meant the 50th wedding anniversary, which would be celebrated after 50 years from the initial date, so the correct answer is (A) 01/06/2008, as it is 50 years after Jan 2, 1958.

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, that means it's either December 31, 2014 (since there are 24 hours in a day and we need to count for both days), or January 1, 2015 (if the 36 hours include the transition from December 31 to January 1). Since we're looking for a date a month ago, we go back to November 30, 2014, which is one day before December 1, 2014. So the date would be 11/30/2014, but since we need the format MM/DD/YYYY, the answer is (C) 11/23/2014, which is the 23rd day of November, not the 30th. This might be an error in the options provided, but based on the context, (C) is the closest.

If the deadline is 2 days away from now, and it's June 1st, 2021, then today is May 30th, 2021. A month ago from today would be May 30th, 2021 minus 30 days (since May has 30 days). That gives us April 30th, 2021. Therefore, the answer is (E).

If today is 4/19/1969, then 10 days ago would be 4/9/1969 because we subtract 10 from 19 (ignoring the day of the week), and since we're subtracting from the 19th, we don't need to adjust the month. Therefore, the answer is (F) 04/09/1969.

Given that Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and it is their 5-year anniversary today, we can add 5 years to the initial date:

If the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933, that means yesterday was 11/22/1933 and today is 11/23/1933. A month ago would be 10/23/1933, since October has 31 days and we're counting back one month from November 23rd. However, since there are only 30 days in October, we need to subtract two more days from 10/23/1933 to account for the missing days at the beginning of the month. So the correct date is 10/21/1933. None of the options match this date exactly, but (D) 10/25/1933 is the closest, as it is four days after the actual date a month ago.

If Jane got her job in 2016 and today is her 3-year work anniversary, today is December 2, 2019. One week ago from today would be November 25, 2019, which is written as 11/25/2019. However, none of the options directly match this date. The closest option is (A) 11/23/2019, which is one day before the actual date.

Since this is the last day of 1899, today's date is 12/31/1899. To find 10 days ago, we subtract 10 from 31, but since we can't have a negative day in the month, we subtract 10 from the next month (January). So, 10 days before 12/31/1899 is 12/21/1899. The answer is (D).

Since John is correct and today is 6/19/2019, we know the actual date is June 19th. One year ago from today would be June 19, 2018, so the answer is (A) 06/19/2018.

If Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then, we can calculate the number of days in each month from March to September:

- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days

Total days in these months = 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 184 days

Since 176 days have passed, we subtract those from the total:
184 - 176 = 8 days

Now, add this to March 20, 2020 to find the date 8 days later:

Mar 20 + 8 days = Mar 28, 2020

Yesterday would be one day before Mar 28, which is Mar 27, 2020. However, since we're looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to consider that March has only 31 days, so Mar 28th was not possible, and we would have moved to April 1st.

So, the date yesterday (which is March 31st) in MM/DD/YYYY format is:

03/31/2020

This is not among the given options, but if we consider that the question might be asking for the date in the future (since 176 days have passed), we would look for the next date after Mar 31st in the same month. Since there are no more days in March, we move to April 1st, 2020.

Therefore, the answer is closest to (E) 10/09/2020, but it should be (E) 04/01/2020, which is not listed as an option. However, given the context, it seems like there might be an error in the options provided. The correct answer would be March 31st, 2020, which is not listed, or April 1st, 2020, which should be considered as an approximation since it's not listed either.

If today is 9/7, and Jane is watching an event from 2003, we can infer that the date is not the current year but rather a past year. Since 9/7 is already in September, it is more likely that this is the current month, so yesterday would be one day before 9/7, which is 9/6. The year remains 2003 because there is no information to suggest it's a different year. So the answer is (A) 09/06/2003.

The first quarter of a year consists of January, February, and March. Since today is the last day of the first quarter, it must be March 31, 2008. A month ago would be February 28, 2008, as February 29 occurs only in a leap year, and 2008 is not a leap year. So the answer is (D).

If yesterday was 12/31/1929, then today is 01/01/1930. 10 days before today would be 12/21/1929, but since there is no 32nd day in December, we subtract 1 to account for the leap year (1930 is not a leap year), so the correct date is 12/20/1929. However, this option is not among the given choices. The closest choice would be (A) 12/22/1929, which is two days after the actual date, so it's not correct. The best answer from the options provided would be (E) 09/22/1929, as it is 10 days before 10/01/1929, which is the first day of October.

So the answer is (E).

If Jane got her job in 2016 and today is her 3-year work anniversary, then today is January 2, 2019 (since 2016 + 3 years = 2019). Her second day at work was December 2, 2016. 10 days before December 2, 2016 would be November 22, 2016. So, the date 10 days ago is 11/22/2016. None of the provided options match this date exactly, but the closest is (F) 11/22/2019, which is the same date but for a different year. Since we don't have a year specified in the question, we can only provide the date part, so the answer is (F).

Today is Apr 10, 1985. Jane's appointment is 3 days later, so we add 3 days to today's date: 
Apr 10 + 1 (1 day) = Apr 11
Apr 11 + 1 (another day) = Apr 12
Apr 12 + 1 (final day) = Apr 13

So, 24 hours later is the next day, which is Apr 13, 1985. Therefore, the answer is (B) 04/13/1985.

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, that means it's either December 31st or January 1st, since New Year's Day is always on January 1st. Since 36 hours is two full days, we can subtract those 36 hours from 24 hours to find out what the date was 24 hours before the start of 2015. 

24 hours before 12:00 AM on January 1st would be 9:00 PM on December 31st. Therefore, 24 hours later would be 12:00 AM on January 1st, 2015. So the answer is (D).

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, that means it's either December 31, 2014 (since there are 24 hours in a day), or January 1, 2015 (with an additional 12 hours). Since we're looking for 10 days before that, we subtract 10 days:

- If it's December 31, 2014, 10 days ago would be December 21, 2014 (31 - 10 = 21).
- If it's January 1, 2015, 10 days ago would be December 21, 2014 (01 - 10 = -9, but since it's December, we add 31 to get December 21).

Both options lead to the same date, December 21, 2014. So the answer is (E) 11/21/2014 because December 21 is before January 1. However, this is an error as it should be (D) 12/18/2014 since 10 days before December 21, 2014, is December 18, 2014.

Final Answer: (D) 12/18/2014

Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Since December has 31 days, today is January 1st, 1930. 24 hours later would be January 2nd, 1930, which is 01/02/1930. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).

If yesterday was 12/31/1929, today is 01/01/1930 (since it cannot be 12/32/1929). One year ago from today would be 01/01/1929, as we go back one year from 1930. So the answer is (F).

If today is 9/7, then one week ago would be 9/7 minus 7 days, which is 9/1 (since we don't count the 7th as part of the previous week). However, since we're looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format with the year provided (2003), we can deduce that the correct answer is 09/01/2003, which corresponds to (A) 09/05/2003 because the 1st is not included in the given date range for NFL 2003. So the answer is (A).

Given the options and the context provided, there seems to be an inconsistency in the date format for the NFL 2003 event. Assuming that the question means the first day of the 2003 season rather than the exact date of the event, the correct answer would be (A) 09/05/2003, as it represents the start of the NFL season, which typically begins in early September.

If May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, that means it is her current date. If this is actually ten years ago, then today's date for Jane is May 6, 2002. One week ago from today would be May 1, 2002. So the answer is (C) 04/19/2002 because April 19th is the day before the 1st.

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017. She ate one egg per day. To find out when she runs out of eggs, we subtract the number of eggs from the number of days:

40 eggs / 1 egg/day = 40 days

Adding these 40 days to the initial purchase date:

May 9, 2017 + 40 days = May 28, 2017 (since May has 31 days, so we go to June)

Now we check the options:

(A) 06/17/2017 - This is not the correct date because she would have run out on June 16th.
(B) 07/16/2017 - This is not the correct date because it's after June 16th.
(C) 06/18/2017 - This is the correct date, as it's one day after she would have run out on June 17th.
(D) 06/18/2016 - This is not the correct date because it's before May 9, 2017.
(E) 06/18/2054 - This is not the correct date because it's in the future.
(F) 12/18/2016 - This is not the correct date because it's more than a year after May 9, 2017.

The correct answer is (C) 06/18/2017.

If Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, and this is her 5th visit, that means she started going there in October 2009 (1st visit), November 2009 (2nd visit), December 2009 (3rd visit), January 2010 (4th visit), and now it's February 2010 for her 5th visit.

Today is 05/04/2004. One week from today means adding 7 days to the current date. So, we add 7 days to 05/04/2004:

- 05/05 + 1 = 05/06
- 05/06 + 1 = 05/07

Since Jane saw a meteor shower twice in 1973, we know that the second time must be around the same date as the first time. Meteor showers often have a consistent period. If today is March 5th, and it's her second viewing, it's likely that the first viewing was also around the same time of year, possibly a few weeks earlier.

10 days before March 5th would be February 25th, but since meteor showers are not usually associated with specific days, it's more reasonable to assume that the first viewing was also around February 25th or a few days before. Since we can't determine the exact day of the first viewing, the best answer would be an approximate date close to February 25th.

(A) 02/23/1973 is closest among the options given, so that would be the answer.

None of the options match this exact date, but the closest one is (A) 01/09/1961, which is only 4 days after the correct date.

Since Jane visits the bookstore every 16th of the month, starting from October 2009 (which would be her first visit), we can calculate the number of months passed since her first visit to find out today's date. October 2009 + 4 visits = 4 years + 4 months (since there are 12 months in a year, and 4*12 is 48, so we add 4 more months for the 5th visit).

Now, 4 years is 4 * 12 = 48 months, so 48 + 4 = 52 months have passed since October 2009. October has 31 days, November has 30, December has 31, January has 31, February has 28 (assuming a non-leap year). We can add these up: 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 = 151 days.

So, from October 31st, we need to count 151 days to get to the 16th day of the next month. Since 151 days is more than 31 (in November) but less than 60 (the number of days in December), we know it's in December. December has 31 days, so subtracting 151 from 31 gives us 151 - 31 = 120 days left in December.

120 days is 3 months, plus an extra 1 day because 30 days in March is not enough. So, we move to April, which has 30 days, and add 1 day. That brings us to April 1st.

Since we've already passed the 16th of February (which is the 52nd day), the next 16th will be on the following month, which is March 16th (31 + 15). However, since we're counting from the 17th of February, we add one more day to March 16th to get to March 17th.

Therefore, tomorrow's date is 03/17/2010. The answer is (C).

Since today is the 12th, we subtract 12 days from 12th to account for February having fewer days than March. February 12th minus 12 days is February 1st. Therefore, the date a month ago would be 02/01/2002. None of the options exactly match this date, but option (D) 02/08/2002 is the closest, as it's 7 days earlier than our calculated date.

So the answer is (D).

The first quarter of a year has 90 days (3 months). If today is the last day of the first quarter, it's the 90th day. Since today is March 31st, one week ago would be March 24th, which is 03/24/2008. So the answer is (F).

If today is March 5th and this is Jane's second time seeing a meteor shower in 1973, that means she saw another meteor shower on March 4th, which would be one day before March 5th. So yesterday's date was March 4th, 1973. The answer is (B).

If today is September 9, 1909, a month ago would be August 9, 1909, since we subtract one month from September to get August. Therefore, the answer is (A) 08/09/1909.

Since the question states that Jane is watching NFL 2003, we can infer that the current day is within the year 2003. Given that today is 9/7, the month and day are already provided, so the correct answer is (D) 09/07/2003.

So the final answers are:

If today is 9/7 and Jane is watching NFL 2003, that means the current year is 2003. Since we're looking for 24 hours later, we simply add 1 day to the current date. So, 9/7 + 1 day = 9/8. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is 09/08/2003. The answer is (A).

Today is the fourth Thursday of November 2001. One week from today will be the following Thursday. Since there are only five weekdays between any two Thursdays in a week, one week later it would be the 11th day of the month (since today is the 4th), and it's still in November because Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday of the month. Therefore, the date is 11/11/2001 plus one week, which is 11/18/2001. However, since we need the date in the format MM/DD/YYYY for the next year, we add one year to 2001, making it 11/18/2002. So the answer is (C) 11/30/2002, but since we are looking for the date one week after Thanksgiving, not the actual date one year later, the correct answer is (A) 11/29/2002.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Since John is correct and thinks today is 6/19/2019, we know today's date is June 19, 2019. 10 days before today would be June 9, 2019, which is 06/09/2019. So the answer is (C).

Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020. To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract 30 days (since February has 28 or 29 days, but we'll approximate for this calculation) from the current date. Since 176 days have passed, we subtract 176 from 30 days:

30 - 176 = -146

This means 146 days before the quit date would be before March 20, which is not possible. However, we need to consider that we're looking for the date exactly a month before the quit date, so we should subtract 31 days instead, as March has 31 days.

31 - 176 = -145

So, the date is 145 days before March 20, 2020, which brings us back to February 20, 2020 (since February has 28 days). Now we need to count back another month, which is January:

1 month - 20 days = -10 days (not possible, since there can't be a negative number of days in a month)

We made an error in our calculation. We should have considered the full year after March 2020. Since it's already past March, we go to April, which has 30 days.

Apr 30, 2020 - 176 days = -146 days

Now, we need to subtract 31 days for the month before April:

Apr 30 - 31 = -1

So, the correct date is March 30, 2020. Since we want the date a month ago, we subtract another 31 days:

Mar 30 - 31 = -1

This again gives us an impossible result, but we know that we need to go back one month from March, which is February:

Feb 29, 2020 (leap year, so February has 29 days) - 31 days = -2

This means we need to count 2 months before March 20, 2020, which is January:

Jan 20, 2020 + 31 days (to account for February) = Feb 20, 2020

Now we need to find the day 10 days before February 20, 2020:

Feb 20 - 10 = Feb 10, 2020

However, this date is not in the list of options. The closest option to Feb 10, 2020 is (B) 07/29/2020, which is an incorrect assumption because it's July, not February.

The correct answer should be a date close to Feb 20, 2020, but not provided in the options. The options provided do not accurately represent the situation described in the question.

Therefore, there is no correct answer among the given options.

If it was September 1st, 2021 a week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from that date. September 1st minus 7 days gives us August 25th (since we don't count the day the week started). Tomorrow would be August 26th, which is 08/26/2021. However, none of the options exactly match this, but the closest is (A) 09/09/2021, which is 8 days after September 1st, not 1 day. But since the question asks for the date "tomorrow", it would be the day following August 26th, which would be September 1st, 2021 (since September has 30 days, and today is the 1st), so the correct answer is not among the given options. If there were no other choices, the best we can do is select the next day in the month, which would be (F) 09/13/2021.

Answer: (F) 09/13/2021

If it was September 1st, 2021 a week ago, that means 7 days before September 1st is August 25th, 2021. 24 hours later from August 25th is August 26th, which is still in the same month. So the date 24 hours later would be September 1st, 2021 itself because we're just counting a day within the same month, not advancing to the next month. Therefore, the answer is (E) 09/02/2021, which is the correct date 24 hours after September 1st, 2021.

If the deadline is 2 days away from now, that means today's date is May 30, 2021 (since June 1st is 2 days after May 31st). One year ago from today would be May 30, 2020. So the answer is (B) 05/30/2020.

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, that means it's either December 31, 2014 (since there are 24 hours in a day), or January 1, 2015 (since 36 hours after December 31 is January 1). Since we're looking for the date one year ago from today, we go back to the same day of the previous year.

If today is December 31, 2014, one year ago would be December 31, 2013. If today is January 1, 2015, one year ago would be January 1, 2014. However, since we're asked for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, and January 1 is typically written as 01/01, the correct answer should reflect that. Therefore, if it's January 1, 2015, one year ago is 01/01/2014.

So the answer is (B) 01/19/2014, but this choice doesn't match the context. It seems like there might be an error in the options provided. If the correct option should have been 01/01/2014, the answer would be (B) because it's the only one that corresponds to the date one year before 01/01/2015.

Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and ate one egg per day. To find the date she ran out of eggs, we subtract the number of eggs from the number of days in May (31) and add one (for the last day of the month). 

31 - (40 - 1) = 31 - 39 = -8

This calculation is incorrect because it gives a negative number, which doesn't make sense. The correct way to calculate the last day is to subtract 30 (since April has 30 days) and then add the remaining eggs:

30 - 30 + 1 = 1

So, Jane ran out of eggs on May 1st, 2017. A month ago would be April 1st, 2017, which is not in the given options. However, since the options don't include the correct date, the best answer would be the closest one that comes before May 1st.

The closest option is (A) 05/04/2017, which is 4 days before May 1st, 2017. Although not perfect, it is the most reasonable choice among the options provided.

If May 6, 1992 feels like yesterday to Jane, that means it was yesterday for her, which would be May 7, 1992 (since we add one day to go from yesterday to today). If that is actually ten years ago, then today's date is May 7, 2002. 24 hours later from May 7, 2002, is May 8, 2002, which is not among the options provided. However, since there are no exact match for May 8, 2002, we can look for the closest option that is two days after May 7, 2002. That would be May 9, 2002, which is represented by (A) 05/15/2002 because May has 31 days, so 9th would be the 15th day of the month.

So the correct answer, even though it's not directly listed, would be (A) 05/15/2002.
