Emily could have gone to the soccer field between the time when she finished fixing her computer at 1pm and the field closed at 8pm. So, the answer is (C) 1pm to 8pm.

However, since the options don't include the full range from 1pm to 8pm, we need to choose the closest option that includes part of this time. The only option that overlaps with the available time is (D) 1pm to 2pm. This means Emily could have gone to the soccer field between 1pm and 2pm before the field closed.

Answer: (D) 1pm to 2pm

None of the given time periods between 8am to 10pm include going to the construction site. However, we can infer that Emily could have gone to the construction site between 11am (when she was no longer at the rooftop) and 1pm (before she started working at the office). The closest option is (C) 8am to 9am, but it doesn't fully cover the time when Emily could have gone to the construction site. The best answer would be (C), but it's not entirely accurate since it misses the time between 11am and 1pm.

Given the options and the context, there isn't a perfect answer, but (C) 8am to 9am is the most reasonable choice because it's the only time period before her other activities start, and it's not ruled out by the construction site's closing time. If there were a (C) option that included both 8am to 9am and 11am to 1pm, that would be the ideal answer.

The only time period after the library and before the dance studio closes that is not accounted for is 12pm to 9pm. Therefore, Emily could have gone to the dance studio between 12pm to 9pm.

However, option (B) 8pm to 9pm is not correct because the dance studio would already be closed by 9pm. The correct answer is the time from 12pm to 9pm, but since it's not an exact match in the options, we can choose the closest one that includes part of this time frame, which is (C) 9pm to 10pm.

So the answer is (C).

From the given information, there is no specific time mentioned for David to go to the clothing store after 10am. However, since the store is closed after 3pm, David must have gone before that time.

The only time window available after David left the train station at 10am and before the store closed at 3pm is from 10am to 3pm. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 10am to 3pm.

The museum closure time: 10pm.

Since the museum was closed after 10pm, Andrew couldn't have gone there between 10am to 10pm. The only time frame before the museum closed is from 11am to 8pm, but this includes the time when he was buying lunch. The exact time between 10am and 11am when he wasn't engaged in an activity outside the potential museum visit is not specified.

Therefore, the best answer is (D) 11am to 8pm, as it includes the time when he might have gone to the museum, but we cannot be sure if he actually visited during that time since there's no information about his activities during that specific hour.

The beach closure time: 10pm.
None of the given time periods between 5am and 10pm include a time when Leslie could have gone to the beach, as they were occupied with other activities. The only option that includes a potential beach visit is 9pm to 10pm, right before it closes. However, this is not a "between" time but rather the last possible time for them to go to the beach. Since we're looking for a "between" time, there isn't a correct answer based on the given information.

Therefore, the answer is: There is no suitable time provided between the given activities for Leslie to have gone to the beach.

The amusement park closure time: 10pm.
None of the provided time periods fall within the amusement park's open hours, which would be between 1pm and 9pm, as all activities seen afterwards take place after closing time. Therefore, there is no time when Mary could have gone to the amusement park according to the given information.

However, since there is no other option than the ones provided, we can choose the most likely time based on the sequence of events. Since the last activity mentioned before the amusement park closes is Kimberly seeing Mary at work from 9pm to 10pm, it seems plausible that Mary might have gone to the amusement park immediately after work, if she did not engage in any other activities in between.

2pm-7pm: buying cookies at a bakery.
7pm-8pm: buying clothes at the mall.
8pm-10pm: working out at the gym.

The only time window when Emily could have gone to the orchestra hall is before her other activities started or after they ended. Since the hall was closed at 10pm, Emily could have gone between 6am (after waking up) and 2pm (before her first activity), or between 8pm (after finishing working out) and 10pm (just before closing). However, since the question asks for the time "could" be, we should include both options if they overlap.

So, the correct answer is:
(D) 6am to 2pm
and
(C) 8pm to 10pm

Together, these cover the entire possible time period before the hall closed.

Hannah cannot have gone to the art studio between 6am to 8am because she was at the library or cafe during that time. Similarly, she cannot have gone between 7pm to 8pm because she was walking towards the Statue of Liberty. The only available time for her to go to the art studio before it closed would be between 10am to 6pm, but since the studio is closed after 8pm, we should exclude the time from 8pm to 10pm as well.

Therefore, the correct answer is the time when she was not engaged in other activities, which is from 8am to 10am. However, since the studio was already closed by then, the actual time frame would be just from 8am to 8pm.

Sarah cannot have gone to the gas station between 9am to 11am because she was already there until 11am. Similarly, she cannot have gone between 2pm to 9pm because the gas station would be closed by then. The only possible time for her to go to the gas station is during the gap between 11am and 2pm, before she started buying cookies. So the answer is (A) 11am to 2pm.
