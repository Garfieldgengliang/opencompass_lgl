In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the conjunction "because," which suggests that it refers to the subject that preceded it, which is "the patient." Therefore, "he" is referring to the patient who had a rare skin condition. So the correct antecedent for "he" is:

(A) The patient had a skin condition

The answer is not (B) because the specialist is not the antecedent for "he" in this context, and there is no ambiguity about the reference, so the answer is not (C).

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to after the conjunction "and". The antecedents for "he" could be either "the scientist" or "the artist" since both were mentioned together in the previous part of the sentence. The verb "shared" might help us decide, as it is a common action for both scientists and artists.

Considering the sentence structure, "he shared a story" follows the subject that is more likely to share a story, which is usually a person involved in storytelling. Given that "collaborated" suggests a shared activity, it's more reasonable to assume that "he" refers to the person who brought their expertise to the collaboration.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "he" in this context is "the scientist", as scientists often share stories, especially when collaborating with artists. So the answer is (A). The artist could potentially share a story too, but based on the information provided, the pronoun "he" is more clearly associated with the scientist.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "she" typically refers to a female subject, and in this context, it's clear that the subject of using big words is related to communication between the developer and the writer. Since the sentence implies that someone's use of big words is causing difficulty in communication, it's logical that "she" refers to the person who is using those words. Given the options, the antecedent must be the writer, as the writer is the party mentioned in the second part of the sentence who could potentially use big words. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The writer uses big words.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the conjunction "and." The conjunction indicates that the pronoun refers to the subject that comes before it, which in this case is "the scientist." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the scientist." So the correct answer is:

(A) The scientist will share a story

The use of "he" to refer to "the scientist" is clear in this context, and there is no ambiguity.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent for "their" could be either Bailey's or the director's since both are singular nouns that can possess an office. The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine which one it is.

Therefore, the pronoun "their" is ambiguous, and the answer is (C). Without additional context, we cannot say whether it is Bailey's office or the director's office.
  2%|█▋                                                                                     | 5/250 [03:13<2:37:37, 38.60s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "she" refers back to. Here, there are two potential antecedents: "the developer" and "the designer." Since the verb "liked" is in the past tense, it implies an action performed by one of these two individuals. 

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the argument is related to liking the design. If "she" were to refer to the developer, the sentence would be awkward ("The developer argued with the designer because the developer liked the design"), as the developer wouldn't argue with themselves over their own preferences. Therefore, it is more likely that "she" refers to the designer, as the developer would argue against the designer's preference.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The designer liked the design

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female subject, we need to look for a female subject in the previous clause that could be too late. The only female subject mentioned is "the witness," so the antecedent of "she" is most likely the witness. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The witness was too late.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what or whom "them" refers to. The antecedent for "them" must be someone who could be asked to open the door. The sentence mentions two people: the guard and the cleaner. Since the verb "called" is typically used to involve two parties in a conversation, it's reasonable to assume that the guard is the one doing the calling and the cleaner is the recipient of the request.

Therefore, the guard is the one asking, and the cleaner is the one being asked. The antecedent for "them" is "the cleaner," so the correct answer is (B).

Final Answer: B) Asked the cleaner

The pronoun "he" in this sentence could potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist since the previous clause mentions that they are collaborating. Without additional context to disambiguate, the antecedent of "he" is unclear. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  4%|███▏                                                                                   | 9/250 [05:38<2:16:42, 34.04s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "his" could potentially refer to either the customer or the chef since both are people and could have culinary training. The sentence structure does not provide enough context to definitively determine which person the pronoun is referring to. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  4%|███▍                                                                                  | 10/250 [06:08<2:10:55, 32.73s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The antecedent of "he" must be the noun that the pronoun logically refers to based on the context provided. Here, the sentence says "The mechanic disliked the cashier because _ is arrogant." The pronoun "he" comes after the clause "the cashier," and the reason for the dislike is given by "because he is arrogant." Since "arrogant" is a trait typically attributed to a person, it's logical that "he" refers to the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is "the cashier."

Therefore, the correct antecedent of "he" is (B) The cashier is arrogant.

Final Answer: B) The cashier is arrogant.
  4%|███▊                                                                                  | 11/250 [06:38<2:06:25, 31.74s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, "Bailey planned to meet the director at his office," the pronoun "his" is used to indicate possession. Since "his" typically refers to a male possessive pronoun, we need to consider whether it is referring to Bailey or the director. 

If "his" refers to Bailey, the sentence would mean that Bailey planned to meet the director at Bailey's office, which doesn't make much sense in the context of a meeting. If "his" refers to the director, it means Bailey planned to meet the director at the director's office, which is a more plausible scenario.

Given the gendered use of "his" in English, it is more likely that "his" refers to the director, as it is common for a male title like "director" to use "his" for possessive purposes. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is the director's office.

So the answer is (B) The office was the director's office.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the subject of the verb "told," and it refers to the person who received the fake story. Since the writer is trying to fool someone, it is logical to assume that the target of the deception would be the salesperson, not the writer themselves. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is the salesperson.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Told the salesperson a fake story.
  5%|████▍                                                                                 | 13/250 [07:50<2:12:49, 33.63s/it]================================================================================================================================
The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support" refers to a shared possession or group. Since "the writer" is mentioned alongside "their friends," it is logical to assume that "their" refers to the writer's friends, as the writer would be the one requiring support to publish the story.

Therefore, the antecedent for "their" is "the writer's friends."

So the correct answer is:

(A) They were the writer's friends

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "gave." Since "gave" is a verb that typically follows a direct object, the antecedent of "her" must be the noun that is receiving the action. In this case, that noun is "the housekeeper," as the chief is giving something to the housekeeper. Therefore, the correct interpretation of "gave her some tips" is that the housekeeper is receiving the tips.

So the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is "the housekeeper." The answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" refers to the subject of the verb "had purchased," which is typically understood to be the noun immediately preceding the pronoun. Here, that noun is "the house." So the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the house" and not "the homeowner" or "the inspector." Therefore, option (A) is the correct choice.

The sentence can be rephrased to make it clearer: "The homeowner asked the inspector if the house (that the homeowner had purchased) was structurally sound." This clarifies that the pronoun "they" refers to the homeowner, not the inspector.

So, the answer is:
(A) The homeowner had purchased

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to connect back to a subject. We need to identify what "he" refers to since there are two potential antecedents: "the developer" and "the writer." The verb "focuses" suggests an action related to the subject. 

The sentence says that "the developer was unable to communicate with the writer," which implies that the reason for this inability is related to the focus of one of them. If "he" referred to the developer, the sentence would mean that the developer's focus on code prevents communication with the writer. However, if "he" referred to the writer, it wouldn't make sense, as the writer's focus wouldn't be the cause of the developer's inability to communicate.

Given that the focus on code is mentioned as the reason for the inability to communicate, it is most likely that "he" refers to the developer. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the developer, and the correct answer is:

(A) The developer focuses on code.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer back to one of two possible antecedents: the supervisor or the employee. The key phrase to focus on is "stellar performance," which typically refers to the accomplishment or work being evaluated. Since the feedback is given by the supervisor to the employee, it's logical to assume that the "stellar performance" being referred to is that of the employee, as the supervisor would be providing feedback on their work.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "his" is the employee's performance. So the answer is (B).
  7%|██████▏                                                                               | 18/250 [10:45<2:22:39, 36.89s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to determine what it refers to, either the lawyer or the cashier. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "he" is replacing. The sentence structure suggests that "he" is doing something because of the need to understand the case. Since "he" follows the verb "needed," it is most logically connected to the subject that is performing the action of needing, which is typically the lawyer in this context.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the lawyer. So the answer is (A) The lawyer needed to understand. The sentence does not imply that the cashier needed to understand, so option (B) is incorrect. The pronoun is unambiguous in this case, as it clearly refers to the lawyer.
  8%|██████▌                                                                               | 19/250 [11:14<2:12:37, 34.45s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, "his" is a possessive pronoun, so it should refer to something that belongs to someone. The context suggests that the subject of the sentence, the mechanic, is the one doing the action (calling) and giving information about a car.

The sentence says, "The mechanic called to inform the customer that his car would be ready in the morning." Given that the mechanic is the one calling and giving the update, it is logical to assume that "his" refers to the mechanic's car, as the mechanic would be the one whose car needs work.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) It was the customer's car

So, the answer is (B), not (C) because the pronoun "his" does not refer to the mechanic's car, but rather the car that belongs to the customer, which the mechanic is informing about.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the verb "were repairing." We need to identify who is doing the repairing based on the context provided. The sentence starts with "The worker told the pedestrian," so it's likely that the subject of the修理动作 is related to the person being told something. Since the worker is the one communicating the action, it's reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the worker.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the worker. So the correct answer is:

(A) The worker was repairing

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. We need to consider whether it refers to the taxpayer or the accountant. The sentence structure suggests that the taxpayer is seeking help, so it's likely that "they" refers to the accountant, as the accountant is the one who would typically provide help with tax preparation. However, without additional context, it's not definitive. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

The ambiguity comes from the fact that it's unclear if "they" is the taxpayer asking for help or the accountant being asked if they can provide assistance.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "liked" is the clue here, as it tells us what action the antecedent performed. The antecedent must be someone who could like a design. The sentence structure is: "The developer argued with the designer because [the antecedent] liked the design."

Since the developer is the subject of the first part of the sentence and the argument is about the design, it is more logical that the developer is the one who liked the design, as they would have a reason to argue over it. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is the developer.

So the answer is (A) The developer liked the design. The sentence is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" appears after a clause that describes an action ("always teaching the assistant new techniques"). The pronoun "they" is typically used to refer back to the subject of the previous clause, which in this case is "the cook." Therefore, the most logical antecedent for "they" is "the cook."

So the correct interpretation is (A) The cook likes to teach.

The reason (B) The assistant likes to teach is not correct because the sentence structure implies that the teaching is coming from the cook, not the assistant. And since there is no other clear antecedent for "they" in the sentence, it is not ambiguous. Thus, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the clause "because," which provides context for what the pronoun is referring to. The clause "because he is an expert on rare skin conditions" explains the reason for the referral. Since "he" is placed after "the specialist," it is most logical that "he" refers to the specialist, as the specialist is the one being described as an expert on rare skin conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The specialist is an expert.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to identify what "she" is referring to. The antecedent can be either the technician or the customer, since these are the only female noun phrases in the sentence. The verb "completed" suggests an action, and based on common usage, when a technician tells a customer about completing a repair, it is typically the technician who performs the action.

So, the most logical antecedent for "she" in this context is the technician. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) The technician completed the repair

The pronoun "she" is unambiguous in this case, referring to the technician.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the person who received the prototype. The antecedent for "him" must be the person the carpenter collaborated with and gave something to. Since the carpenter collaborated with the designer, it is logical that "him" would refer to the designer, as the designer is the one receiving the prototype.

So the correct answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype. The sentence does not provide enough context to suggest that "him" could be ambiguous, as the collaboration with the designer naturally leads to the assumption that the designer is the recipient.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they." The pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the secretary or the developer based on the context. The clause "because they better understood the problem" suggests that the person who understands the problem better is the one who corrected the other person.

If "they" refers to the secretary (Option A), the sentence would mean: "The secretary corrected the developer because the secretary better understood the problem."

If "they" refers to the developer (Option B), the sentence would mean: "The secretary corrected the developer because the developer better understood the problem."

However, since the sentence implies that the secretary is correcting someone (the developer) due to a superior understanding of the problem, it's more logical to assume that "they" refers to the secretary. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is the secretary.

So the correct answer is:
(A) The secretary understood the problem

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the undergraduate applying to work with the scientist is because of a need for a lab assistant. The antecedent of "he" must be the person who needs the assistant, which is typically the subject performing the action. Since the undergraduate is the subject who is applying, it is logical that "he" refers to the undergraduate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The scientist needed an assistant

The undergraduate is applying to help the scientist, so it's not the undergraduate who needs an assistant, but rather the scientist. Thus, the pronoun "he" is ambiguous if we don't have additional context, but based on the sentence provided, the most appropriate interpretation is that the scientist is the one needing an assistant.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used to refer to the performance of someone. Since "their" can be used for both singular and plural subjects, we need to analyze if the sentence supports either the supervisor's or the employee's performance.

The sentence structure is: "The supervisor gave the employee feedback on [their] stellar performance." Here, "the employee" is the direct object of the verb "gave," and "stellar performance" is what the feedback is about. It's logical that the feedback would be related to the performance of the person receiving it, which in this case is the employee.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is most likely to be "the employee's performance." So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what it is referring to since it could potentially refer to either the salesperson or the writer. The verb "sold" suggests an action directed towards someone, and the context indicates that the salesperson is attempting to deceive. Therefore, it is logical that the person being fooled and subsequently sold something would be the target of the deception.

The correct antecedent for "them" in this context is the person who is being fooled, which is typically the receiver of the product or service in this case. Since the writer is the one being fooled, it is most likely that "them" refers to the writer.

So the answer is (B) Sold the writer some garbage.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he". The pronoun "he" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause or action. The subject of the first part of the sentence is "the driver," and the second part starts with "after he broke a window." Since "he" comes after the word "after," it logically refers to the person whose action comes immediately before, which is the subject of the first clause.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the tailor," as the tailor is the one who broke the window. So the correct answer is:

(B) The tailor broke a window

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second part of the clause, which starts with "that". We need to determine if "he" refers to the visitor or the teacher. Since the visitor is the one who is telling the teacher something, it is more logical that "he" would be referring to the visitor in this context. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the visitor.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The visitor liked the cake

This means that the sentence can be rephrased as "The visitor told the teacher that the visitor liked the cake," which makes sense. The pronoun "he" is clear in this case, so there is no ambiguity.

The pronoun "she" in this sentence can potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist, since the previous clause states that the scientist will collaborate with the artist. Without further context to disambiguate, the antecedent of "she" is unclear. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is used after the action "asked." The verb "asked" is the key to understanding the antecedent, as it is the main action being performed. The antecedent for "him" must be the person who could receive feedback. Since the sentence states that the designer showed the blueprint and then asked for feedback, it is logical that the person being asked for feedback would be the cook, who is the recipient of the blueprint.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the cook. So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the cook

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer to a person. The antecedent could be either "my parent" or "the secretary," depending on the intended meaning. The sentence structure suggests that the parent is the one calling someone, and that someone is a secretary. So, it's likely that "his" refers to the parent, as it's more common for a parent to call their secretary.

Therefore, the antecedent for "his" is "my parent," making option (A) the correct interpretation: "They were my parent's secretary." However, without further context, there is a slight ambiguity because "his" could also potentially refer to the secretary if the secretary has a shared secretary. In most cases, the antecedent is clear, but in this case, the answer is (C) Ambiguous due to the potential double meaning.

The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun "she" is likely to be referring to the person who would have to mop the floor if the child stepped on it. In this context, the warning is coming from the janitor to the child, so it makes more sense for "she" to refer to the janitor, who is the one responsible for mopping the floor.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the janitor. The correct answer is:

(A) The janitor would have to mop

So, the answer is (A), not (C) since there is no ambiguity regarding the antecedent of "she" in this case.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining its antecedent. The sentence structure suggests that "she" is providing a reason for why the developer couldn't communicate with the writer. Given the context, it is more logical that the person who is focusing on code would be the one hindering communication, as developers typically deal with code while writers usually focus on writing.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" in this context is the writer, as the writer's focus on code would prevent effective communication with the developer. So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent for "they" must be the subject of the previous clause that refers to someone working on the house. Since the sentence begins with "The carpenter told," it's logical to assume that "they" would be referring to the carpenter, as the carpenter is the one doing the action of working on the house.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" is the carpenter. So the answer is (A) The carpenter had been working on the house.

The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support" could potentially refer to either the writer's friends or the friends referred to collectively by "her friends." The context suggests that the writer is involved in the publication process, so it's more logical that "their" refers to the writer's friends, as they are directly related to the story's publication. However, without additional context, we cannot be completely certain.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

(D) Ambiguous

The sentence is ambiguous because it's not clear whether "their" refers to the writer's friends or the friends of the writer's friends.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "the physician," which might lead one to assume that "they" refers to the physician. However, without additional context, it's also possible that the assistant is asking the physician if they (the physician) could borrow money on behalf of someone else. Since there's no clear indication that the pronoun is exclusive to one person, the antecedent is ambiguous.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is used after the action of asking. Since "the cleaner" is the subject that performed the action of calling and asking, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "them" refers back to the person being asked, which is "the guard." Therefore, the antecedent of "them" is "the guard."

So the correct answer is (B) Asked the guard.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" must refer to someone who is doing the action of standing in front of the door, as that is the reason for greeting the receptionist. Since "he" is used after "the mechanic greets," it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the person who is performing the action of greeting, which is the mechanic. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the mechanic.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The mechanic is standing in front of the door.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used after the word "discuss," which implies that someone's grading policy is being discussed. The two possible antecedents for "his" are "the educator" and "the student," since each could potentially have a grading policy. However, the context of "meeting with a student" suggests that the student is more likely to be the one whose grading policy would be discussed. Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation is that the pronoun "his" refers to the student.

So the answer is (B) It was the student's grading policy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, "was too late." We need to identify what "he" refers to. The antecedent of "he" could be either the investigator or the witness, as both are people who could be late. However, the context suggests that "he" is likely referring to the person who was trying to interview the witness, which is typically the investigator, not the witness, as the investigator is the one taking the action.

Therefore, the most logical antecedent for "he" in this context is the investigator. So the answer is (A) The investigator was too late.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus of our analysis. We need to identify what "they" is referring to. Since "Alex" is mentioned as the subject of the sentence and the one doing the telling, it is logical to assume that "they" refers back to Alex, as Alex is the one expressing their ability or inability to meet.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "Alex". So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. We need to determine who needs to understand the case. The context suggests that the lawyer is looking into illegal accusations against the cashier, so the lawyer's actions are the focus.

The verb "needed" implies a motivation or purpose for the action. Since the lawyer is the one performing the investigation, it is logical that the pronoun "they" refers to the lawyer, as the lawyer is the subject of the sentence.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the lawyer, not the cashier. So the answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is typically the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun replaces. Here, "he" refers back to a male subject. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the nurse running is related to someone smelling awful. Since "the laborer" is the only male person mentioned in the sentence immediately preceding the pronoun "he," it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the laborer.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) The laborer smelled awful

So the answer is (B).

The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support" can be ambiguous, as it could potentially refer to either the writer or the writer's friends. We can analyze the options:

(A) If "they" refers to "the writer's friends," it would mean that the writer and their friends' support is necessary for publication.
(B) If "they" refers to "the friends' friends," it implies that the support of the friends of the friends is needed for publication.
(C) "They" cannot refer to the story's friends because a story does not have friends in this context.

Given the context, the most likely antecedent for "their" is either the writer or the writer's friends, so the answer is (D) Ambiguous, as it's unclear whether "they" refers to the writer or the friends without further context.

The pronoun "she" in the sentence is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence suggests that someone is greeting another person because they are in a particular position. The two potential subjects for "she" are the mechanic and the receptionist, as they are both mentioned in the sentence.

The clause "because she is standing in front of the door" provides the reason for the greeting. If "she" refers to the mechanic (Option A), the sentence would imply that the mechanic is greeting the receptionist because the mechanic is standing in front of the door, which is unlikely since the mechanic wouldn't greet themselves.

If "she" refers to the receptionist (Option B), the sentence makes sense, as the receptionist could be the one being greeted and standing in front of the door, which is a reasonable scenario.

Since there are two distinct possibilities for the antecedent of "she," the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "told" indicates that the subject is giving advice to someone else. The subject of the sentence is "the worker," so it is more logical that the advice is directed towards the person being addressed, which is "the pedestrian." Therefore, "she" refers to "the pedestrian."

The correct interpretation of the sentence is: "The worker told the pedestrian that the pedestrian should avoid the closed portion of the street."

So the answer is (B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "met" suggests that someone is having a meeting, and "because" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship. Since "her" comes after "the designer," it is most likely referring to the designer's idea, as designers typically have ideas that need to be implemented.

So, the correct antecedent for "her" is the designer. Therefore, the answer is (B) The designer's idea could be implemented. The sentence does not provide enough context to suggest that the developer's idea could be implemented using "her" in this case.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to identify what "he" refers to. The antecedent of "he" should be the subject of the previous clause where "had been working" is the action. The clause before the pronoun is "The carpenter told the onlooker," so "he" must be referring to the carpenter because the carpenter is the one doing the action of working on the house.

Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the carpenter. The correct answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "uphold the peace." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the clauses before the pronoun to see who could logically be performing the action of upholding the peace.

The first clause is "The sheriff protected the writer." Since the sheriff is a person capable of protecting someone, it is reasonable to assume that the sheriff is the one performing the action of protecting. Therefore, it makes sense that "they" would be referring to the sheriff, as the sheriff is the one carrying out the action that connects to upholding the peace.

So the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "The sheriff." The correct answer is (A) The sheriff upholds the peace. The sentence is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus of our analysis. We need to identify what "he" is referring to in the context of the sentence. The sentence structure suggests that "he" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is "could not meet." Since the verb "tells" implies that Alex is communicating information to "us," it's reasonable to assume that "he" is referring to the person who Alex is telling about their inability to meet.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "Alex." So the answer is:

Therefore, the answer is (B). The pronoun "them" is not ambiguous in this context, as it clearly refers to the clerk.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to refer back to one of the two nouns mentioned earlier, "mechanic" or "cashier." Since the sentence states that the mechanic disliked the cashier due to a quality attributed to "they," it is logical that the pronoun "they" is referring to the person who is disliked. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" must be the cashier, as the mechanic is the subject of the sentence and wouldn't be described as arrogant.

So the answer is (B) The cashier is arrogant.

The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun "she" is referring to the person who has a better understanding of the problem. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject that follows "because" and explains why the developer corrected the secretary. In this case, "the secretary" is the one who is better understood to have the problem understanding. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is "the secretary."

So the answer is (B). The secretary understood the problem.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent of "her" can be either Bailey or the director, as "her" is commonly used to refer to a female individual. Since the sentence mentions Bailey planning to meet the director, it's reasonable to assume that "her" could be referring to either one, as they are both people who could potentially have an office.

However, without additional context, it's not clear whether "her office" specifically refers to Bailey's office or the director's office. Therefore, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous in this case. The correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after both "customer" and "chef," making it unclear which person's culinary training is being referred to. The correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who is being described as an expert on rare skin conditions. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject that follows "because," which is "the specialist" in this case. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for referring the patient to the specialist is because the specialist has expertise.

So the correct answer is:
(B) The specialist is an expert

Since the sentence clearly states that the specialist is the one with the expertise, there is no ambiguity regarding the antecedent of "she." Therefore, the answer is not (C) ambiguous.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both mentioned as individuals who will be discussing something. The pronoun "their" typically refers to both of these people when used together, indicating shared possession or experience. Since "favorite dishes" is a common topic for both a reporter and a chef, it's reasonable to assume that they would be discussing each other's favorites.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is both the reporter and the chef, as they will be discussing each other's favorite dishes. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous (since there is a clear context where "their" refers to both individuals, but it's also clear that they are discussing each other's dishes)

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "because they used big words." To determine the antecedent, we need to find out who would logically use big words in the context of communication problems. Since the first part of the sentence states that "the developer was unable to communicate with the writer," it is most reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the person who is causing the communication barrier, which would be the writer in this case.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the writer." The correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. We have two possible subjects for "her": the pathologist and the victim. Since microscopes typically belong to the person conducting the examination, it's more logical for "her" to refer to the pathologist, who is the one using the microscope.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is the pathologist, which means the microscope belongs to the pathologist. So the answer is (A).

The pronoun "he" in the sentence "Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor" is ambiguous without additional context. The antecedent could be either Alex or Taylor, since the pronoun is referring to the subject of the previous clause. Here, "he" could be either:

1. If "he" refers to Alex: "Before Alex sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor." In this case, "he" would mean Alex, and the antecedent is (A) Alex sent the letter.

2. If "he" refers to Taylor: "Before Taylor sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor." In this case, "he" would mean Taylor, and the antecedent is (B) Taylor sent the letter.

Since the sentence does not provide enough information to unambiguously determine whether "he" refers to Alex or Taylor, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "disclosed" suggests that someone is sharing information, and "had a history of substance abuse" is the information being disclosed. Since the patient is typically the one sharing personal information like this with a counselor, it is logical that "he" refers to the patient.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(A) The patient had a history

So the answer is (A).

The pronoun "she" in this sentence is ambiguous because it could refer to either the scientist or the artist, as both are female gendered nouns and the antecedent of "she" has not been clearly distinguished.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female person, and "the secretary" is the only female person mentioned in the context provided, the most logical interpretation is that "she" refers to the secretary. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "The secretary."

So the correct answer is (B) The secretary made a mistake.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is the key to determining the antecedent. The possible antecedents for "their" are "producers" because "producers" is the noun that could logically own an office. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the office referred to is the producers' office.

So the answer is (A) The office was the producers' office. The sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that "their" refers to Sam, as there is no clear context to imply that Sam has an office that the producers would own.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the subject of the verb "told," and it is clear from the context that it refers to the person being fooled, which is the salesperson, not the writer. The writer is the one trying to fool someone, so it wouldn't make sense for the writer to be the one receiving a fake story. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the salesperson. The correct answer is:

(B) Told the salesperson a fake story

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what "them" refers to since there are two possible antecedents: "the carpenter" and "the designer." The verb "gave" suggests an action being done to someone, and the context of collaboration between the carpenter and the designer implies that "them" is receiving the prototype.

Since the carpenter collaborated with the designer, it is reasonable to assume that the prototype would be given to the person they worked together with, which is the designer. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "them" in this context is "the designer."

So the answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" appears after the verb "gave." To determine the antecedent, we look at the previous part of the sentence where there is an action that can logically be associated with the pronoun. The antecedent is the person who receives the action. Here, the action is "gave a discount."

The antecedent for "him" must be someone who could receive a discount. The only two people mentioned in the sentence who could receive a discount are the carpenter and the clerk. Since the carpenter is the one making the desk and giving the discount, it is more logical for "him" to refer to the clerk, as the clerk is the one receiving the benefit of the discount.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Gave the clerk a discount. The pronoun "him" is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" must be determined. The sentence mentions two people: the lawyer and the cashier. "She" could potentially refer to either one, depending on the context. However, the clause "because she needed to understand the case" provides a clue about the reason for the action.

The lawyer is the one looking into the accusations, so it makes more logical sense that the need to understand the case would be related to their investigation. Therefore, it is more likely that "she" refers to the lawyer in this context.

So the answer is:

(A) The lawyer needed to understand

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "could pay." The antecedent for "they" must be the subject that has the ability to perform the action of paying. Since "they" follows the action of telling, it is more logical that "they" refers to the person receiving the instruction, which is typically the person being addressed. Here, the customer is the one who is being told what they can do, so the antecedent of "they" is most likely the customer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The customer could pay

The pronoun "they" is clear in this context and refers to the customer, making the option (C) ambiguous incorrect.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "because." The antecedent of "they" must be determined based on the context. The two possible subjects for "they" are "the librarian" and "the CEO," since these are the only two individuals mentioned before the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that "they" is the one performing the action of asking, which is necessary for the librarian to help the CEO find the book.

Considering the verb "asked," it's more logical for "they" to refer to the person who initiated the request for help, which would be the one seeking the book. Since the librarian is helping the CEO, it is more reasonable to assume that the CEO asked, as the librarian is responding to that request.

Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is "The CEO asked." So the correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" appears after the coordinating conjunction "and," which suggests that it is referring to the subject that comes before it. Since the two subjects are "the scientist" and "the artist," the antecedent of "they" could be either one.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining its antecedent. The sentence structure is "The assistant asked the physician if [subject] needs any help." Since "she" is typically used to refer to females, and the physician is the other person mentioned in the sentence, it is logical that "she" would refer to the physician in this context.

So the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the physician, which corresponds to option (B): Asked if the physician needs help. The sentence does not suggest that the assistant is asking if they need help, as that would be counterintuitive since the assistant is the one asking.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "needed to get more rest." The antecedent of the pronoun must be the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is referring to. The sentence structure suggests that the warning is being directed towards someone, which is why it's most logical that "they" refers to the patient, since the surgeon is the one doing the warning.

So, the correct antecedent for "they" is "the patient." Therefore, the answer is (B) The patient needed more rest.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the surgeon or the nurse, since both are mentioned as people who could need more time. The verb "warned" suggests that someone is giving a cautionary statement to another person, but without additional context, it's not clear who the warning is directed towards. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The possible antecedents for "he" are the worker and the pedestrian, as they are both mentioned before the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that someone is giving advice to another person. Since the verb "told" typically implies instruction or advice, it's more logical that the person giving the advice would be directing it to the person receiving it. Therefore, the pronoun "he" most likely refers to the pedestrian, as the worker is the one doing the telling.

So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was in a good mood." We need to determine whose mood it is referring to.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" refers to the entity that Sam met with, which is "the producers."

In the given sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure suggests that someone is asking a question to another person, using the pronoun "he" to refer to the recipient of the question. The verb "asked" is the main action, and it is followed by the subject "the assistant" and the clause "if he needs any help."

Since the clause is about the possibility of needing help, it makes more logical sense that the question is being directed towards the person who might require assistance. In this context, that person is typically the one who is being addressed, which is "the physician" (not "the assistant"). Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" in this sentence is "the physician."

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to in the sentence.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent of "they" should be the subject of the clause that explains why the practitioner made a house call.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "review" suggests that someone is looking at or examining something. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun, we need to find what it is possessed by. The options are either the student or the architect.

If "her" refers to the student, the correct antecedent would be "the student's blueprints," which is option (A).
If "her" refers to the architect, the correct antecedent would be "the architect's blueprints," which is not listed as an option.

Given that "her" could potentially refer to either the student or the architect, the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" refers to the antecedent that Sam is associated with. Since the sentence states that Sam went to "his" office after meeting with the producers, it implies that the office belongs to Sam, as he is the subject performing the action of going to the office. Therefore, the antecedent of "his" is Sam's office.

The correct answer is:
(B) The office was Sam's office.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the subject of the verb "told," and it refers to the person who received the communication. The sentence structure suggests that the construction worker is the one doing the action (calling) and sharing information (the whole story). Therefore, it is logical that "him" refers to the recipient of the call, which is the editor, not the construction worker. So the antecedent of "him" is the editor.

The correct option is (B) Told the editor the story. The pronoun "him" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the editor.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent for the pronoun "they." The verb "made" suggests that the subject of the action is doing the action of making a mistake. Since the pronoun "they" is used after the conjunction "because," it is likely referring to the reason for the developer meeting with the secretary. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that the mistake is related to the meeting, so it's more likely that the secretary made the mistake, as the developer wouldn't typically meet with their own secretary because of their own error.

Therefore, the antecedent for "they" is the secretary. The answer is (B). The secretary made a mistake.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used, which can potentially refer to either the educator or the student. The verb "discuss" suggests that someone is sharing or talking about a policy, so it's unclear whether the policy being discussed is the educator's or the student's. Without additional context, we cannot definitively determine which person's policy it is. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

So the answer is (C).

The pronoun "her" in the sentence "After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office" could potentially refer to either Sam or the producers, depending on the context. However, based on common usage, when someone mentions going to their "office" after an event, it is usually understood that they are referring to their own personal office.

In this case, since "Sam" is the subject of the sentence and the action of going to the office comes after the meeting with the producers, it is most likely that "her" refers to Sam. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is Sam, not the producers. So the answer is (A) It is Sam's office. However, without additional context, there is a possibility for ambiguity, so it could also be considered slightly ambiguous due to the potential double reference to Sam's or producers' office. If we were to choose between the options given, we would lean towards (A) as the primary intended meaning.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to determine what it is referring to, either the nurse or the laborer. The clause "because she smelled awful" provides the reason for the action described in the first part of the sentence. Since "smelled awful" is a negative quality typically associated with someone, it's more logical that "she" would be describing the person being avoided, which in this context is the laborer, as the nurse is the one running.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the laborer. The correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" must refer to the person or group that received the blueprint from the designer. The antecedent of the pronoun "them" must be the noun or pronoun that the verb "gave" is connected to. Here, "gave" is connected to "them," which means the antecedent must be the direct object of the verb "gave." The sentence states that the designer collaborated with the carpenter, so it is logical to assume that "them" refers to the carpenter, as the carpenter is the other person mentioned in the context of receiving the blueprint.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second clause "was in a good mood." To clarify the antecedent, we need to look at the context provided by the first clause. The first clause is "The mechanic greets the receptionist," which suggests that the mechanic is performing an action (greeting) towards someone. Since the pronoun "she" follows this action and is typically used to refer to a person being greeted, it is most logical that "she" refers to the person being greeted, which in this case is the receptionist.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is:

(B) The receptionist was in a good mood.

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "wrote," which suggests that "they" refers to the subject that performed the action of writing. Since "the writer" is the subject that comes immediately before "they" and it makes logical sense that the writer would be the one who wrote a good book, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is clear.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer wrote a good book.

In the sentence, "Alex did not know Taylor until she sent a letter," the pronoun "she" is crucial to determine its antecedent. The verb "sent" is a clue to the subject of the pronoun, as it must be someone who performed the action. Here, "until" indicates that the action of sending a letter was what led to Alex knowing Taylor.

The antecedent of "she" must logically be the person who sent the letter, which in this context is Taylor, since the sentence suggests that Taylor's action of sending a letter was the point of introduction. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is Taylor, not Alex.

So the answer is (B) Taylor sent the letter.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context is that the taxpayer is meeting with the accountant for help with tax preparation. The pronoun "she" could potentially refer to either the taxpayer or the accountant, since both are female gendered nouns. However, the verb "help" suggests an action being offered, and it's more common for an accountant to offer help with tax preparation than a taxpayer seeking help from someone else. Therefore, it's more likely that "she" refers to the accountant.

So the answer is (B) The accountant could help.

In this sentence, we need to identify whose idea is being referred to by the pronoun "their." The antecedent of "their" should be the subject that owns the idea that can be implemented. The sentence has two potential subjects: "the developer" and "the designer."

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the meeting between the two is because one of their ideas can be implemented. If "their" refers to the developer, the sentence would read: "The developer met with the designer because the developer's idea can be implemented," which would favor option (A). If "their" refers to the designer, the sentence would read: "The developer met with the designer because the designer's idea can be implemented," which would favor option (B).

Given that the sentence does not specify whose idea it is, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous. Without additional context, we cannot definitively say which person's idea is meant.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" refers to the subject of the clause that precedes it. The clause is "the house ... was structurally sound," and "he" must be referring to the person who owns the house, since the context suggests the owner is concerned about its structural integrity. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is "the homeowner."

So the correct answer is:

(A) The homeowner had purchased

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "the physician". Since "the physician" is the subject of the clause "asked if", it is the most logical antecedent for the pronoun "they".

So the answer is (B) Asked if the physician needs help.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the word "because," which indicates a cause or reason for the mechanic's dislike.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he." The pronoun "he" can potentially refer to either the developer or the secretary, as both are singular nouns that could be the subject of the sentence after "because." Let's analyze each option:

(A) If "he" refers to the developer, the sentence would mean that the developer met with the secretary because the developer made a mistake. This makes sense in the context, as it's common for someone to meet with someone else after making a mistake.

(B) If "he" refers to the secretary, the sentence would mean that the secretary met with the developer because the secretary made a mistake. However, this interpretation is less common, as typically a secretary wouldn't meet with a developer because of their own mistake, unless the secretary was responsible for coordinating the meeting.

Given the two possibilities, the pronoun "he" is ambiguous without additional context to clarify whether it refers to the developer or the secretary. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used to refer to the subject of the previous clause, which is the person receiving the information. The subject of the previous clause is "the customer," so the pronoun "their" should logically refer to the customer's possession.

In this sentence, "her" is the pronoun we need to clarify. Since "the reporter and the chef" are both singular nouns, the antecedent could be either one.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining its antecedent. We have two possible antecedents: "the designer" and "the carpenter." The verb "gave" is important here. If "her" refers to "the designer," it would mean that the designer gave a blueprint to themselves, which is unlikely. On the other hand, if "her" refers to "the carpenter," it makes sense, as the designer is giving something to the person they collaborated with.

Since the sentence does not specify to whom the blueprint is being given, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous, and we cannot definitively say whether it refers to the designer or the carpenter. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "asked". To determine the antecedent of "her," we need to see who could be the one being asked to clean the room. The antecedent for "her" must be a female, as "her" is a feminine pronoun. The options given are "designer" and "janitor." Since "janitor" is typically a female job title, it is more likely that "her" refers to the janitor.

Therefore, the antecedent of "her" is the janitor. The correct answer is (B) Asked the janitor.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We need to determine who the pronoun is referring to: the technician or the customer. Since the sentence states that the technician is communicating to the customer, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "he" refers to the subject performing the action, which in this context is the technician. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the technician.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second part of the clause after "that". The antecedent of the pronoun must be the noun or pronoun that "he" is replacing. The possible antecedents are "visitor" and "teacher". However, since the verb "likes" is in the third person singular form ("likes"), it implies that the subject is singular. 

The sentence structure suggests that the visitor is telling the teacher something, so it's more likely that "he" refers to the visitor, as it would be more logical for the visitor to express their liking for the cake. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the visitor.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The visitor likes the cake

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to determine what "they" is referring to since it could logically refer to either the paralegal or the client. The verb "forgot" and the action "to file paperwork" suggests that someone responsible for filing is at fault. Since "file paperwork" is typically associated with the paralegal's job, it is more likely that "they" refers to the paralegal. However, the sentence also implies a consequence for this action, which is being fired.

Given that the sentence states "so they were fired," it's reasonable to infer that "they" refers to the person who committed the error, which is the paralegal. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the paralegal.

The correct answer is:
(A) The paralegal was fired

However, if we consider the possibility that "they" could be ambiguous and could refer to either party, the sentence would be ambiguous, so option (C) is also a valid interpretation if there is no additional context to clarify. In this case, without further context, the most accurate answer is (A) because it directly connects the action to the person responsible.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "asked." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the context and see who would logically ask for a tool. The sentence states that the laborer handed the secretary a hammer, which implies that the action of handing over a tool is related to the request.

The reason for the action is given as "because they asked for a tool." Since the laborer is the one physically performing the action (handing over the hammer), it is more reasonable to assume that the person asking for the tool is the laborer, not the secretary, as the secretary is receiving the tool.

Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is the laborer. The correct answer is:

(A) The laborer asked for a tool.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "warned" suggests that the speaker is communicating something that might affect the person being warned. Given the context, the pronoun "she" is most likely referring to the person who is receiving the warning, which is the nurse in this case. Therefore, the antecedent for "she" is the nurse.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The nurse needed more time

The sentence implies that the surgeon is telling the nurse that the nurse (not the surgeon) requires additional time to prepare. Hence, the pronoun "she" refers to the nurse, making the antecedent unambiguous.

In the given sentence, "The physician told the baker that he had cancer," the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "told" suggests that the subject of the first clause (the one containing "that") is speaking about themselves when using the pronoun "he."

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "helped" is the action, and "her" is the indirect object receiving the action. The antecedent of "her" should be the person to whom the action is directed. The sentence mentions "the analyst's office," which suggests that the person being referred to is likely the one whose office is being visited, i.e., the analyst.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is "the analyst," so the answer is (B). The secretary is helping the analyst book a flight, not herself. The sentence structure is clear in this context, and there is no ambiguity regarding the antecedent of "her."

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the action, and the pronoun "her" indicates who was being asked to do something. The subject of the verb "called" is "the cleaner," and it is this person who typically performs the action of asking someone else.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The verb "had" is in the past tense, indicating that someone possessed or experienced cancer at some point in the past. We have two possible subjects for the pronoun "they": the physician and the baker. The verb "told" suggests that the subject is the one imparting information, which typically implies that the person speaking would be the one with the relevant experience.

Considering this, if "they" refers to the physician, then the sentence would read: "The physician told the baker that the physician had cancer" (Option A). If "they" refers to the baker, then the sentence would read: "The physician told the baker that the baker had cancer" (which is less likely since the physician wouldn't typically share such personal information unless it was relevant to their medical expertise).

Given the context, the most likely interpretation is that the physician is sharing their own diagnosis, so the antecedent of "they" is the physician. Therefore, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "called," and it needs to be determined whether it refers to the cousin or the boss. Since the cousin is the subject of the sentence and the action of calling is performed by the cousin, it is logical that "they" refers to the person who made the call, which is the cousin.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "they" is "My cousin." This means option (A) is the correct interpretation: "They were my cousin's boss." This is because the cousin is calling their boss for more information, not the boss's boss. The pronoun "they" in this context is unambiguous.

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to identifying the antecedent. Since "they" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause, we need to look at the subject of the sentence "The engineer informed the client." The engineer is the one doing the informing, so logically, it is the engineer who would need to make the future payments.

Therefore, the antecedent of "they" in this context is the client, as the engineer is telling the client what they (the client) need to do. So the correct answer is:

(B) The client should make payments

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to identify what "they" refers to, either the nurse or the laborer. The sentence states that the nurse stayed away from the laborer due to a reason. The reason given is "because they were very busy."

If "they" refers to the nurse, the sentence would read: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because the nurse was very busy." This doesn't make logical sense, as the nurse wouldn't typically stay away from another person because they are busy.

If "they" refers to the laborer, the sentence would read: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because the laborer was very busy." This makes more sense, as the nurse could stay away if the laborer is busy.

Since the sentence can logically be interpreted as either the nurse or the laborer being busy, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context clues come from the verb "applied" and the reason given for doing so, which is "because she needed a lab assistant." Since the undergraduate is the one applying, it is logical that "she" refers to the undergraduate in this context, as the undergraduate is the one seeking the position of a lab assistant.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is the undergraduate. So the answer is (A) The undergraduate needed an assistant. The sentence does not imply that the scientist needs an assistant, only that the undergraduate's need for an assistant was the motivation for applying. Hence, there is no ambiguity here.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second clause "was repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible." To determine the antecedent, we look at the context provided by the first part of the sentence. "The worker told the pedestrian" suggests that the speaker is communicating something about an action to the pedestrian. Since the pronoun "she" is coming after the subject "the worker," it is most logical to assume that "she" refers back to the worker, who is the one doing the action.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The worker was repairing. The pronoun "she" is not ambiguous in this case.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the main action, and it's followed by a clause with "if" introducing a question. The subject of this clause is "he," which must be referring to one of the two people mentioned before it: "the assistant" or "the physician."

Since "he" comes after "the physician," it is more likely that "he" refers to the physician. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the sentence is that the assistant is asking the physician if they (the physician) could borrow some money. So the answer is (B).

Given all the analysis, the correct answers are:

A: The chief took the day off (A)
B: The secretary didn't reply yet (A)
C: Ambiguous (C) (in the last example, it's ambiguous whether "he" refers to the assistant or the physician)

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "protected" suggests an action performed by the subject, and "because" introduces a reason for the protection. Since "she" comes after "the writer," it is most likely referring to the writer, as the sheriff protecting someone is a typical action. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is "the writer."

So the correct answer is (B) The writer upholds the peace.

As we did in the previous examples, we need to determine who the pronoun "he" is referring to in this sentence. Here, "he" could potentially refer to either the chief or the counselor, as both are mentioned in the context. The sentence structure is: "The chief told the counselor that [he] took the day off," where "he" fills in the blank.

If "he" refers to the chief, the sentence would read: "The chief told the counselor that the chief took the day off."
If "he" refers to the counselor, the sentence would read: "The chief told the counselor that the counselor took the day off."

Since the sentence does not provide enough context to unambiguously determine which person is meant, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the key to determining the antecedent. The sentence structure indicates that "the secretary" performed an action, and "him" refers to the recipient of that action. Since "the analyst's office" was mentioned, it is logical to assume that the action of booking a flight would be done for the person whose office was being visited, which is the analyst.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that "him" refers to the "analyst," not the secretary. So the answer is (B) Helped the analyst book a flight.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent, which the pronoun refers to, must be determined based on the context. Since the sentence states that the technician is communicating to the customer, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "she" is referring to the customer, as the technician is providing information to the customer about payment options.

So, the correct antecedent for "she" in this context is the customer. Therefore, the answer is (B) The customer could pay. The sentence structure suggests that the customer has the ability to pay with cash, as per the technician's statement.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second part of the conditional clause "otherwise he would have to mop it all over again." The antecedent for "he" must be someone who would have to mop if the child stepped on the wet floor. 

The sentence structure suggests that the "he" is connected to the previous action of warning the child, so it's more likely to refer to the person who is issuing the warning, which is the janitor. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the janitor.

So the correct answer is (A) The janitor would have to mop.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject of the clause that explains why the nurse stayed away. The clause "because she was very busy" provides that explanation. Since "she" is singular and refers to a female, the most logical antecedent for "she" in this context is the nurse, as the laborer is not typically referred to as "she" in this situation.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is the nurse. So the answer is (A) The nurse was busy. The sentence does not suggest that the laborer is busy, so option (B) is incorrect. The sentence is not ambiguous about the subject of being busy, so option (C) is also incorrect.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to understanding its antecedent. The verb "warned" suggests that the subject is giving advice or information to someone else. The sentence structure indicates that the subject of the warning is the one who needs to take action, which is typically the person being warned. Therefore, "she" refers to the patient, not the surgeon.

So the correct antecedent for "she" is the patient. The answer is (B) The patient needed more rest.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both singular nouns that could potentially be the antecedent of the pronoun "his."

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure indicates that the hygienist is communicating advice to the patient.

Thus, the answer is (B) The patient should floss.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "informed" suggests that someone is giving information to another person. The subject of the sentence is "the engineer," and since the pronoun "she" follows, it is most likely referring back to the subject who is providing the information. Therefore, "she" would be referring to the "engineer."

So the correct antecedent for "she" is "The engineer." The client is the recipient of the information, but "she" is not the one who needs to make payments on time according to the sentence structure. Hence, the answer is (B) The client should make payments. The pronoun is unambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "because they focus on code." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the context provided in the sentence.

The sentence states that the developer was unable to communicate with the writer because of something related to focusing on code. Since the reason given is about the inability to communicate, it is logical to assume that the person who is preoccupied with coding is the one hindering communication. In this case, that person would be the developer, as the sentence is discussing the developer's inability to communicate.

Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is the developer. So the correct answer is:

(A) The developer focuses on code

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" is the person being addressed by the verb "asked." Since the verb "asked" is directed towards the physician, it's logical to assume that the pronoun "she" is referring to the physician. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the assistant is asking the physician if _she_ (the physician) could borrow some money.

So, the answer is (B) Asked if the physician could borrow money. The ambiguity here is resolved based on the context of the sentence, which indicates that the physician is the one being asked for money.

In this sentence, we need to identify what "their" refers to since it can be either the student's or the architect's blueprints. The antecedent for "their" should be determined based on the context provided by the action of setting up a meeting to review blueprints.

The sentence suggests that the student is taking the initiative to meet with the architect, which implies that the student is likely the one seeking review or has an interest in the blueprints. Therefore, it is more reasonable to assume that "their" refers to the blueprints that the student is bringing or discussing with the architect.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) The blueprints were the architect's

However, without additional context, it could also be argued that the student is reviewing the architect's blueprints on behalf of someone else, which would make (A) a valid interpretation. Since there is ambiguity, the most accurate answer would be:

In the given sentence, "The physician told the baker that she had cancer," the pronoun "she" is the key element to determine its antecedent. The antecedent of "she" must be the subject of the clause that "had cancer" modifies. Since "she" comes after the verb "told," it is likely referring to the person who was the recipient of the information, which in this case is the baker.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent of "her" must be a female person, since "her" is used as a possessive pronoun to indicate ownership. The possible antecedents are "parent" and "secretary," but since "parent" is a singular noun and typically wouldn't have a female secretary (as secretaries are usually associated with individuals), the most likely antecedent for "her" in this context is the secretary.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the secretary is being referred to as the one being called. So the answer is:

(A) They were my parent's secretary

This eliminates the possibility of "They were the secretary's secretary" because it suggests that the secretary has their own secretary, which is less likely in this context. The sentence is not ambiguous in terms of the gender of the secretary, so the answer is not (C).

The sentence is structured as follows: "The guard called [someone] and asked [her] to open the door." Since "her" is the object of the verb "asked," it is clear that the person being asked to do something is the one referred to by "her."

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "because he used big words." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who would logically use big words in the context of not being able to communicate with someone else.

The antecedent of "he" must be someone who could potentially use big words and cause difficulty in communication. Since "the developer" is mentioned before "he," it's more likely that "he" refers to the developer, as the reason for the communication issue is related to the developer's choice of words.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The developer uses big words.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "were in a good mood." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify which person or group could logically be in a good mood based on the context provided. The sentence states that the mechanic greets the receptionist because of this reason.

The connection between the two clauses suggests that the reason for the greeting is related to the person being in a good mood. Since the greeting action is initiated by the mechanic, it's more likely that the motivation for the good mood comes from the person performing the action, which is the mechanic. Therefore, the antecedent for "they" in this context is the mechanic.

The pronoun "her" typically refers to the female noun that precedes it, which in this case is "employee." Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is the employee.

So the answer is:

(B) It was the employee's car

This is because the manager is asking the employee to remember their own car, not the manager's car.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both singular nouns, and "his" is a possessive pronoun. To determine the antecedent of "his," we need to see which noun is more logically connected to the idea of having favorite dishes. Since "favorite dishes" typically belong to a person, it is either the reporter's or the chef's.

The sentence structure suggests that two people are discussing something, so it's logical to assume that they are discussing their respective favorites. However, without additional context, we can't definitively say if they are discussing each other's dishes or their own. Therefore, the pronoun "his" is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the clause that follows. We need to identify what "she" refers to. Since "the homeowner" is the subject immediately before the pronoun, it's most logical that "she" refers to the homeowner. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the homeowner.

So the correct answer is:
(A) The homeowner had purchased

The sentence structure indicates that the homeowner is the one asking about the structural soundness of the house they bought, not the inspector. Thus, the ambiguity lies within the clause "the house she had purchased," where "she" refers to the homeowner, not the inspector. Hence, the pronoun is not ambiguous with respect to the inspector.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the conjunction "because," which suggests it is providing a reason for the action of correcting. Since "she" follows "the secretary," it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the secretary, as the secretary is the one performing the action of correcting. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the secretary."

So the correct answer is:

(A) The secretary understood the problem

The sentence implies that the secretary has a better understanding of the problem, which is why she is correcting the developer. There is no ambiguity here; the pronoun is unambiguously referring to the secretary.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was fired." We need to determine what entity is most logically connected to being fired based on the information provided in the first clause. The first clause states that "the paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client," which implies that the paralegal is the one responsible for the action leading to the consequence mentioned in the second clause.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is most likely the paralegal, as it is the person who could be fired for forgetting to file paperwork. So the correct answer is (A) The paralegal was fired. There is no ambiguity in this case.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "should floss every day." To determine the antecedent of "they," we look at the previous part of the sentence where the pronoun could logically refer to. The hygienist is the one giving advice, so it makes sense that "they" would be referring to the patient, who is the one receiving the advice.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" in this context is the patient. So the answer is (B). The patient should floss.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "broke" suggests an action, and "she" is the subject typically associated with breaking something. Given that "she" comes after the verb "broke," it logically refers to the subject that precedes it. In this case, "the tailor" is the subject mentioned just before "she," so the antecedent of "she" is "the tailor."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The tailor broke a window.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" is the person referred to by the pronoun, which is usually the subject of the previous clause or phrase. Here, "Alex tells us" is the main clause, and "that she could not meet" is a subordinate clause introducing additional information. Since "Alex" is the subject of the main clause, it is reasonable to assume that "she" refers back to Alex.

Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is Alex. So the correct answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "gave" is the main action, and "her" is the indirect object of that action. The antecedent of "her" should be the person who receives the action of giving. The possible antecedents for "her" are "the carpenter" and "the clerk." However, since the sentence states that the carpenter made the desk for the clerk, it is more logical that the clerk is the one who would receive a discount as a favor or reward.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" in this context is "the clerk," so the answer is (B). The sentence means that the carpenter gave a discount to the clerk.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" refers to the person the construction worker is communicating with. The verb "called" indicates that the action of calling is directed towards someone, and the verb "told" follows, implying that the story is being shared with that person. Since the construction worker is the one doing the calling and telling, it is logical that "them" refers to the person on the receiving end of the call, which is the editor.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is the editor. The correct answer is:

(B) Told the editor the story

So, the answer is (B), not (C) because the antecedent is clear in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer to a person. The antecedent of "his" should be someone who can call another person's boss. The possible antecedents for "his" are "my cousin" and "the boss." Since the sentence is about my cousin calling someone, it is most likely that "his" refers to my cousin's boss, not the boss's boss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(A) They were my cousin's boss

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the focus. We need to identify what "him" is referring to since there are two potential antecedents: "the salesperson" and "the writer." The verb "sold" suggests that the action is being performed on someone, and the context indicates that the salesperson is attempting to deceive the writer.

The sentence structure implies that the salesperson is the one doing the selling, and the writer is the one being fooled and receiving the product. Therefore, the antecedent of "him" in this context is "the writer," as the salesperson is the one selling "him" something.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

The pronoun "him" is unambiguous in this case, referring to the writer.

In the given sentence, "The reporter and the chef discussed their favorite dishes," the pronoun "their" is used to refer to both the reporter and the chef. Since there are two individuals involved in the discussion, it's not clear whether "their" refers specifically to the reporter's dishes or the chef's dishes. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is ambiguous. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In the given sentence, "The customer and the chef discuss their culinary training," the pronoun "their" is used to refer to both the customer and the chef. Since the sentence implies that both individuals are involved in the discussion, the culinary training being discussed could be both the customer's and the chef's. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is not singular but shared between both parties. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

While neither (A) nor (B) can fully capture the shared nature of the culinary training, the sentence itself is ambiguous because it does not specify which person's training is the main focus of the discussion or if both are equally important.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the verb "needed," and it's important to identify which of the two possible antecedents, the CEO or the accountant, it refers to. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for buying the car is being provided, and "because" introduces a cause-and-effect relationship. Given that the CEO is the one performing the action (buying), it is logical to assume that the need for a car is associated with the person doing the action, which is the CEO.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" in this context is the CEO. So the answer is:

(A) The CEO needed a car

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "asked" suggests that someone is making a request, and the context clues come from the actions of the librarian and the CEO. Since the librarian is the one helping the CEO find the book, it is more logical that the action of asking is attributed to the person who needs assistance, which is the CEO in this case.

Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is most likely the CEO. So the correct answer is (B) The CEO asked.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either Bailey or the director. The antecedent depends on the context and whether the office is understood to belong to the person who is meeting or the person being met. Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whose office it is, the answer is (C) Ambiguous. Without additional context, it's unclear whether "their" refers to Bailey or the director.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the clue that helps us identify who performed the action of asking. Since "he" appears after the verb "asked," it is most likely referring to the subject that performed the asking action immediately before. The previous clause states that the librarian helped the CEO, so logically, "he" would be referring to the person who needed help finding the book, which is the CEO.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is the CEO. So the answer is (B). The CEO asked.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the person who receives the action of receiving the blueprint. The antecedent for "him" should be the person mentioned just before the pronoun. The sentence states that the designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave something to the carpenter. Therefore, "him" refers to the carpenter, as the designer is the one doing the giving.

So the correct antecedent is:

(B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint

Hence, the answer is (B). The pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to connect two actions: correcting the secretary and understanding the problem. The antecedent of "they" must be someone who can both correct and understand the problem. 

We have two possibilities:
1. If "they" refers to the developer, then the sentence would mean: "The developer corrected the secretary because the developer better understood the problem."
2. If "they" refers to the secretary, then the sentence would mean: "The developer corrected the secretary because the secretary better understood the problem."

Given the context, it is more logical that the person who understands the problem would be the one correcting another for having a better understanding. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is the developer. So the answer is:

(A) The developer understood the problem.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the verb "disclosed." The antecedent of "she" must be the subject that performed the action of disclosing. The subject in this case is "the patient," so the pronoun "she" refers back to the patient.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is the patient. So the answer is (A) The patient had a history. The sentence does not imply that the counselor had a history, making option (B) incorrect. The pronoun is unambiguous in this context, so there is no need to choose option (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to identify what it refers to. The antecedent of "she" must be a female noun or pronoun from the previous part of the sentence. The only potential antecedents are "the customer" and "the salesperson," both of which can be female. The sentence structure suggests that someone is asking for a favor, so it's logical to assume that the person making the request would be the one sending the prices.

Therefore, the most appropriate antecedent for "she" in this context is "the salesperson," as it's more common for a salesperson to send product prices in response to a customer's inquiry. So the answer is (B). The customer is asking the salesperson to do something, not the other way around.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "her" typically refers to the gender of the noun that precedes it. Since "the customer" and "the chef" are both singular nouns, we need to consider which one is more likely to be associated with culinary training.

The sentence structure suggests that both the customer and the chef are involved in the discussion. However, it's common for discussions about culinary training to involve someone who has received it, which would typically be the chef, as they are experts in cooking. Therefore, it is more likely that "her" refers to the chef's culinary training.

So the answer is (B) It was the chef's culinary training.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." We need to determine who "she" refers to since there are only two potential antecedents: the patient and the specialist. The verb "had" is the key here, as it indicates possession or occurrence of a condition. 

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the referral is the patient's condition, so it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the patient, as the patient is the one being referred and the one whose condition is mentioned. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the patient.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The patient had a skin condition.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun, it typically refers to the noun that comes immediately before it, which is "student" in this case. Therefore, "her" is most likely referring to the student's grading policy.

So the correct antecedent for "her" is the student, and thus the answer is:

(B) It was the student's grading policy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to connect the reason for the referral. We need to determine whether "they" refers to the patient or the specialist. Since the sentence mentions that the patient was referred "because" of their expertise, it implies that the expertise is what led to the referral. Therefore, "they" is most likely referring to the patient, as the specialist's expertise is the reason for the referral.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The specialist is an expert

However, this answer is not among the given options. The closest option is (C) Ambiguous, which suggests there might be confusion, but in this case, the antecedent is clear based on the context. The correct interpretation is that "they" refers to the patient, so the answer should be clarified as follows:

(C) The patient is an expert

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to. In this sentence, there are only two female characters mentioned: Bailey and the director. The antecedent for "her" must be one of these two. Since "Bailey" is a gender-neutral name, it could potentially refer to either Bailey or the director if it's used as a neutral pronoun. However, without further context or gender-specific information, we cannot definitively say whether "her" refers to Bailey or the director.

Therefore, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous in this sentence, and the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the focus. The antecedent of "her" is the person being fooled. The subject of the verb "told" is "the writer," and the object is "her," which refers to the salesperson. Therefore, the writer is the one telling a fake story to the salesperson.

So the correct antecedent for "her" is the salesperson. The answer is (B). The sentence means that the writer intentionally deceived the salesperson by sharing a false story with them.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "would need to make all future payments on time." To determine the antecedent, we look at the context of the sentence before the pronoun. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing or referring to.

The antecedent for "he" is the person who would need to make the payments. Since the sentence begins with "The engineer informed the client," it's reasonable to assume that the engineer is the one giving the information about payment responsibilities. Therefore, "he" refers to the engineer.

So the correct answer is:
(B) The client should make payments

However, since the sentence structure could imply that the engineer is speaking on behalf of the client (as in "informing" the client about their own responsibility), there is a slight ambiguity. In practice, this would depend on the context provided by the rest of the conversation. But based on the sentence alone, the most likely interpretation is (B).

2. If "their" refers to "secretary," the sentence means "My parent called the secretary's secretary for more information" (option B).

Since "their" could logically refer to either the parent or the secretary, the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is used after the verb "asked." The antecedent of the pronoun "him" must be the person to whom the action is directed. Since "the cleaner" is the subject who performs the action of calling and asking, it is logical that the pronoun "him" refers to the person being asked to do something. Therefore, the antecedent of "him" is the guard, as the cleaner is asking the guard for an action.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the guard

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun "she" refers back to. Here, there are two possible antecedents: "the visitor" and "the teacher." The sentence structure suggests that "she" is likely referring to the person being addressed, which is typically the listener or the one doing the action. Since the visitor is telling the teacher their preference, it's reasonable to assume that "she" refers to the visitor, as the visitor is the one expressing their liking for the cake.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(A) The visitor likes the cake

So, the answer is (A), not (C), because the pronoun "she" is unambiguously referring to the visitor in this context.

If "his" refers to the developer, the sentence would mean that the developer's idea can be implemented, which is option (A).
If "his" refers to the designer, the sentence would mean that the designer's idea can be implemented, which is option (B).

Since the sentence does not clearly specify whose idea it is, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

If "them" refers to the secretary, the sentence would mean the secretary helped the secretary book a flight, which doesn't make logical sense because a person wouldn't typically help themselves book a flight.

If "them" refers to the analyst, the sentence would mean the secretary helped the analyst book a flight, which is a reasonable action for a secretary assisting their colleague.

Given the context and the action of helping, it is most likely that "them" refers to the analyst. Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) Helped the analyst book a flight

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining its antecedent. The verb "gave" indicates an action, and "her" is a possessive pronoun, which usually refers to the direct object of the verb. Since "the designer" is the only female noun mentioned before "her," the most likely antecedent for "her" is "the designer."

So the correct interpretation is that the carpenter gave the prototype to the designer. Therefore, the answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype. The ambiguity is resolved by the context of the sentence.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "warned" suggests that the person giving the warning is the one who needs more time. Since "he" comes after the verb "warned," it is most logically referring to the subject of the warning, which is the surgeon. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the surgeon. 

So the correct answer is:
(A) The surgeon needed more time

Hence, the answer is not (C) Ambiguous, because there is a clear antecedent for the pronoun "he" in this context.

In the given sentence, "The manager asked the employee to not forget his car," the pronoun "his" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We must consider whether "his" refers to the manager or the employee.

- If "his" refers to the manager, the sentence would mean the manager asked the employee to not forget the manager's car, which would be (A).
- If "his" refers to the employee, the sentence would mean the manager asked the employee to not forget the employee's car, which would be (B).

However, without additional context, it's unclear whether "his" is meant to be possessive of the manager or the employee. Therefore, the pronoun is ambiguous, and the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, "My cousin called their boss for more information," the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either "my cousin" or "the boss." The verb "called" suggests that someone is making a call, and the pronoun "their" is used to indicate the person doing the calling. 

(A) If "they" refers to "my cousin," the sentence would mean "My cousin called their own boss for more information," which is plausible since a cousin can call their boss.
(B) If "they" refers to "the boss," the sentence would mean "My cousin called the boss's boss for more information," which is also possible if the boss is relaying information to someone else.

Since both interpretations are valid, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure indicates that "he" is doing the action of writing a good book. Since "the writer" is the subject immediately before "he" and is the one who typically writes books, it's logical to assume that "he" refers to the writer.

So, the correct antecedent for "he" is "The writer." Therefore, the answer is (B). The writer wrote a good book.

In this sentence, "she" is the pronoun we need to clarify the antecedent for. The context suggests that "she" is doing an action (sending the letter) before another person (Alex) knows Taylor. Since the subject "she" comes after the action "sent the letter," it is more logical to assume that "she" is the one performing the action, not the recipient of the knowledge. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the person who is sending the letter.

Looking at the options, (A) and (B) both involve someone sending the letter, but (A) has "Alex" as the subject, and (B) has "Taylor." Since the sentence structure indicates that "she" is the one sending the letter, the correct antecedent is (A). So the answer is:

(A) Alex sent the letter

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they". The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, "they" could potentially refer to either the driver or the tailor, as both are capable of breaking a window. The sentence structure doesn't provide enough information to definitively determine which one is meant.

So, the answer is (C) Ambiguous, as the antecedent of "they" is unclear without further context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "understood" is a key indicator of what "he" is referring to, as it describes an action related to the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the secretary correcting the developer is that one person has a better understanding of the problem than the other.

The phrase "because he better understood the problem" implies that the person who understands the problem better is the one who possesses the knowledge that justifies the correction. Since the secretary is the one performing the action (correcting), it is logical to infer that "he" refers to the one who has the better understanding, which is typically the subject of the verb "corrected". Therefore, in this context, "he" refers to the developer.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The developer understood the problem

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is clearly referring to the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is "the janitor." The verb "asked" is in the past tense, indicating an action performed by the subject of the sentence. Since "him" is used after "janitor," it is clear that "him" refers to the janitor being asked to perform an action. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the janitor. The correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to either the scientist or the artist, since both are working together. The verb "shared" could apply to either of them, depending on the context. Without additional context, it's not clear which one is meant. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, "her" is the pronoun we need to clarify. The antecedent, or the noun that the pronoun refers to, can be either the reporter or the chef since both are female. However, the context suggests that "her" is likely referring to the chef, as the chef is typically associated with discussing dishes. Therefore, it's more logical for "her" to refer to the chef's favorite dishes in this context.

So the correct interpretation is:

(B) They discussed the chef's favorite dishes

The sentence does not provide enough information to definitively rule out the other possibility, but based on common sense and gender associations, (B) is the most likely interpretation. Thus, the answer is (C) Ambiguous, as there is an ambiguity due to the shared gender of the antecedents.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We need to determine whether "they" refers to the investigator or the witness. Since the context suggests that the investigator was trying to interview the witness, it's logical that "they" would refer to the subject that was pursuing the action, which in this case is the interview.

So, "they" being too late would make more sense if it refers to the person who was trying to do something but missed their opportunity (i.e., the one who was behind schedule). That would be the investigator, as they are the one attempting to meet the witness.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The witness was too late

The pronoun "they" is ambiguous in this sentence, but based on the context, it seems to imply that the investigator was too late, not the witness.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." To determine the antecedent of "she," we need to look at the context preceding the pronoun. The sentence says, "The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques," and then adds "because she likes to teach others." Since the action of teaching is being attributed to "she" immediately after describing the cook's action, it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the cook, as the cook is the subject doing the teaching.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is (A) The cook likes to teach.

Final Answer: A) The cook likes to teach.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female person, and the context suggests that the CEO bought a car for someone who needed one, it's reasonable to assume that "she" refers to the person who received the car. In this case, that would be the accountant, as the CEO is the one doing the action of buying the car.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the accountant, which means the correct option is:

(B) The accountant needed a car

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is ambiguous because it can refer to either the customer or the chef, depending on the context. The sentence doesn't provide enough information to determine which person's culinary training is being discussed. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous. Without additional context, we cannot definitively say whether it was the customer's or the chef's training that was being talked about.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun that "she" refers back to. Since "the writer" is the only female noun in the sentence, the pronoun "she" must be referring to "the writer." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the writer." So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer wrote a good book.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining its antecedent. We have two possible antecedents for "his": the pathologist and the victim. Since a pathologist typically uses their own microscope for examining tissue samples, it is more logical that "his" refers to the pathologist's microscope.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) It was the pathologist's microscope

So, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is unambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "she" is replacing. Here, "she" must refer to someone who can be fired, and since "fired" is mentioned after "she," it's clear that "she" refers to a person who has a role that can be terminated due to not filing paperwork. Given the context, "she" is most likely referring to the paralegal, as it's common for an employee to be fired for not fulfilling their job responsibilities like filing paperwork.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the paralegal. So the correct answer is (A) The paralegal was fired.

The pronoun "they" in the sentence "The mechanic greets the receptionist because they are standing in front of the door" could potentially refer to either the mechanic or the receptionist, as both are people mentioned in the sentence. The pronoun "they" acts as a subject for the clause "are standing in front of the door," which describes an action that could logically apply to either person. Therefore, without additional context, it's ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "could help with tax preparation." The antecedent of "he" should be the noun that the pronoun refers to. The possible antecedents are "the taxpayer" and "the accountant." The sentence structure suggests that the taxpayer is seeking help, so it is more likely that "he" refers to the accountant, who is the one being asked if they can provide assistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The accountant could help

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the conjunction "because," which indicates a cause-effect relationship. The antecedent of "they" should be the subject of the clause leading up to the conjunction. Here, that subject is "the patient," who is the one being referred to the specialist. Therefore, "they" refers to "the patient" in this context.

So the correct antecedent is (A) The patient had a skin condition.

In this case, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since the sentence structure is "Bailey plans to meet the director at [his] office," we need to see who the pronoun "his" could logically refer to. Given that "the director" is the one mentioned after "his," it's most likely that "his" refers to the director's office.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is the director's office. So the correct answer is:

(B) It is the director's office.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "could send the prices." The antecedent of "they" must be determined based on the context provided by the first part of the sentence, which is about the customer asking the salesperson something.

The sentence structure is: "The customer asked the salesperson if _ could send the prices."

Here, "they" is a pronoun that logically fits after "the salesperson," since the customer is asking a question to the salesperson. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the salesperson, who would be the one sending the prices if the customer's request is granted.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) The salesperson would send the prices

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to refer back to someone who likes to teach others. We need to identify the subject in the previous clause that could logically perform the action of teaching others. The clause before the pronoun is "The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques," so the logical antecedent for "he" is the person doing the teaching, which is the cook.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) The cook likes to teach

So the pronoun "he" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the cook.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent must be the subject of the clause "felt gravely ill" since it is the action being attributed to someone in the context of the sentence. The two possible subjects are "the practitioner" and "the patient."

- If "he" refers to the practitioner, the sentence would mean: "The practitioner made a house call for the patient because the practitioner felt gravely ill."
- If "he" refers to the patient, the sentence would mean: "The practitioner made a house call for the patient because the patient felt gravely ill."

Given the context, it's more logical for "he" to refer to the patient, as it is common for a doctor to visit a patient who is feeling unwell. Therefore, the antecedent is the patient. So the answer is (B).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after the verb "asked." The verb "asked" is the main action, and the pronoun "her" refers to the recipient of the request for feedback. The sentence structure indicates that the designer is the one showing the blueprint, so it's logical to assume that the designer is asking for feedback, not the cook. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is the person who is being asked, which is the designer.

So the correct answer is:
(B) Asked the designer

The sentence is not ambiguous in this context, as the antecedent of "her" is clear based on the context provided.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to in the sentence "Bailey plans to meet the director at her office." There are two possible referents for "her," which are Bailey and the director. Since the sentence structure suggests that Bailey is planning to meet someone, it is more likely that "her" refers to the person Bailey is meeting, which would be the director.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(B) It is the director's office.

So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to determine who "they" refers to, as there are two possible antecedents: the worker and the pedestrian. The verb "should avoid" indicates an action, and the context suggests that someone is giving advice. Since the worker is the one giving the advice, it is logical that "they" would be referring to the person giving the instruction.

So, the correct interpretation is that the advice is directed towards the pedestrian, not the worker. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the pedestrian. The answer is (B). The worker is the one telling, and "they" refers to the pedestrian, who should avoid the closed portion of the street.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they." Since the pronoun "they" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause, we look back at "The technician told the customer." Here, the subject is "the technician," so "they" would logically refer to the person doing the action of completing the repair. Therefore, the correct antecedent is "the technician."

So the answer is (A) The technician completed the repair. The sentence does not suggest that the customer completed the repair, as that would contradict the subject of the first part of the sentence.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, which modifies the verb "send." We need to identify who is doing the action of sending the prices. The antecedent for "he" should be someone capable of sending the prices. 

The first part of the sentence says "the customer asked the salesperson," which implies that the customer is asking a question to the salesperson. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "he" refers to the person being asked, which in this case is the salesperson, since customers typically do not send prices.

So, the correct interpretation is that "he" refers to the salesperson. Thus, the answer is (B) The salesperson would send the prices.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was repairing the sidewalk." The antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the person who is doing the action of repairing. Since the sentence starts with "The worker told," it is more logical that the person doing the action of repair is the worker, not the pedestrian.

So, the antecedent of "he" in this context is the worker. Therefore, the correct answer is:

In the given sentence, "The reporter and the chef discuss their favorite dishes," the pronoun "their" refers to both the reporter and the chef. This is because the possessive pronoun "their" is used when there is shared ownership or reference. Therefore, both individuals are discussing their own favorite dishes. 

So the correct antecedent for "their" is both the reporter's and the chef's dishes, which means the sentence is not ambiguous in this context. However, since only one option combines both possibilities, there isn't a direct match in the provided choices. We can create a new option:

(D) They discuss both the reporter's and the chef's favorite dishes

Given the options provided, the best answer is (C) Ambiguous, because the antecedent of "their" could be interpreted as either the reporter's or the chef's dishes, depending on the intended meaning of the sentence. Without additional context, it's ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure suggests that "he" is doing the action of asking for a tool, and since the action of handing over a hammer follows the reason, it is logical that "he" is the one requesting the tool. The antecedent of "he" should be the subject who is asking for a tool. The subject "the laborer" is the most plausible choice, as it's common for a laborer to request tools for their work.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "The laborer," so the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to connect to the subject that better understands the problem. The antecedent must be the person who possesses the understanding. We can analyze the sentence structure:

- "The developer corrected the secretary" implies that the developer is taking action.
- "because he better understood the problem" suggests that someone has a superior understanding.

Given that the developer is the one correcting the secretary, it is logical to assume that the developer (A) is the one who better understands the problem, since they are the one performing the corrective action based on their understanding.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) The developer understood the problem

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" refers to the people mentioned just before it, which are "producers." The verb "go" indicates an action related to the location, so the context suggests that after meeting with the producers, Sam will go to a place belonging to the producers. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is the producers, and the correct interpretation is that Sam will go to their office.

So the answer is (A) It will be the producers' office.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" must refer to one of the two nouns mentioned, "nurse" or "laborer," since it's the only other person in the sentence. The verb "smelled" is a verb of perception, so it is more likely to describe the person being perceived as having an unpleasant smell. Given the context of someone running away, it's reasonable to assume that the reason for the action is the person who has an unpleasant smell. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" in this case is the laborer, as it is more logical for someone to be avoided due to their smell.

So the answer is (B) The laborer smelled awful.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining the antecedent. We have two possible referents for "his": the student's or the architect's. The sentence structure suggests that someone sets up a meeting to review blueprints, and since "his" is used after "blueprints," it's logical to assume that the person who owns or is associated with the blueprints would be the one reviewing them.

Given that the architect typically creates blueprints, it's more likely that "his" refers to the architect's blueprints. Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) The blueprints were the architect's.

So, the answer is (B).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is used after the action of asking. To determine the antecedent of "them," we need to identify who the designer asked for feedback. The verb "asked" suggests an interaction between the designer and someone else, and since "them" follows the action of showing a blueprint, it is logical to assume that the feedback would be related to the blueprint. Therefore, the person being asked for feedback is most likely the person who received the blueprint, which is the cook.

So, the correct antecedent for "them" is the cook. The answer is (B). The sentence means that the designer asked the cook for feedback, not the designer themselves.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to understanding the antecedent. The verb "sold" indicates an action performed by the subject, which is "the salesperson" in this case. Since "her" is a female gendered pronoun, it logically refers back to the person just mentioned before it, which is "the writer." Therefore, the antecedent of "her" is "the writer."

So the correct answer is:

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

This means that the salesperson attempted to deceive the writer and ended up selling her something of poor quality. There is no ambiguity in this sentence regarding the antecedent of the pronoun "her."

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure is: "The guard called the cleaner and asked [him] to open the door." Here, "him" refers to the person being asked to perform an action, which is "open the door." Since the action follows "asked," it is logical that the pronoun "him" is referring to the person who was asked to do something. In this case, that person is the cleaner, as the guard is the one doing the asking. Therefore, the antecedent of "him" is the cleaner.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the cleaner

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" could potentially refer to either the visitor or the teacher, since both are mentioned in close proximity. The verb "likes" is the key to determining the antecedent, but without additional context, we cannot definitively say who likes the cake. Therefore, the pronoun is ambiguous, and the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In the sentence "The manager asked the employee to not forget their car," the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either the manager or the employee, as both are singular third-person nouns. The context doesn't provide enough information to definitively determine which car the pronoun refers to. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).
 94%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▉     | 235/250 [2:01:25<06:38, 26.60s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus of our analysis. We need to identify what "he" is referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent of "he" is the noun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, "Alex" is the only male noun in the sentence, and "us" is not a candidate for the antecedent of "he" because "us" is a plural pronoun. Therefore, "he" must be referring to "Alex."

So, the correct interpretation of the sentence is that Alex is the one who cannot meet. Thus, the answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet

The pronoun "he" is unambiguous in this context, referring to Alex.
 94%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▏    | 236/250 [2:01:57<06:35, 28.27s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun is replacing or referring to. Here, "her" is clearly referring to a female individual, and the context suggests that the construction worker is communicating with someone. Given the verb "called" and the phrase "the editor," it is logical to assume that the construction worker is the one doing the calling and telling the story, and the editor is the recipient of the story. Therefore, "her" refers to the editor.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Told the editor the story

The pronoun "her" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the editor.
 95%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▌    | 237/250 [2:02:31<06:29, 29.98s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "upholds the peace." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who has the action of upholding the peace in the context of the sentence. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing.

The first part of the sentence states that "the sheriff protected the writer," which implies that the sheriff is the one performing the action. Since the pronoun "he" comes after the action of protecting, it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the subject of the previous clause, which is the sheriff.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the sheriff, and the correct answer is:

(A) The sheriff upholds the peace

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to. As in the previous example, there are two possible referents for "their": Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" does not provide enough context to definitively choose between the two. Since "their" can refer to either person, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.
 96%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▎   | 239/250 [2:03:29<05:23, 29.42s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since the sentence mentions "Sam" right before the pronoun, it is logical to assume that "her" refers to Sam, as Sam is the subject of the sentence and would typically use a possessive pronoun like "her" to describe their own office. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is Sam.

So the correct answer is:
(B) It will be Sam's office

There is no ambiguity here, as the context clearly indicates that "her" refers to Sam, not the producers.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" could potentially refer to either the visitor or the teacher, since both are people mentioned in the sentence. The verb "liked" is the action being attributed to the pronoun, and it can apply to either one. Therefore, without additional context, it's ambiguous which person the pronoun refers to. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
 96%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▉   | 241/250 [2:04:34<04:41, 31.31s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" must be determined from the context provided. The sentence structure suggests that "she" is being used to clarify whose action is being described in the context of not being able to meet. Since "Alex told us," it's reasonable to infer that the person who is unable to meet is the subject of the previous clause, which is Alex. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is Alex.

So the correct answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet.
 97%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▎  | 242/250 [2:05:00<03:57, 29.63s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent is the entity that "they" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that "they" is the subject of the clause "could not meet." Since "Alex" is the subject of the main clause "Alex told us," it's reasonable to assume that "they" refers to Alex, as Alex is the one doing the action of telling and potentially not being able to meet.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is Alex. So the correct answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet
 97%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▌  | 243/250 [2:05:31<03:30, 30.07s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is typically the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun replaces. Here, the verb "was" suggests a subject, and since "he" is a male pronoun, it's more likely to refer to a person. The sentence structure indicates that the reason for the nurse staying away is related to someone's busyness.

The antecedent must be the person who is described as being busy. The options given suggest that either the nurse or the laborer could be the busy one. However, the phrase "because he was very busy" implies that the subject of busyness is the one who would be avoiding the other person. Given this context, it makes more sense that "he" refers to the laborer, as the nurse is the one staying away.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The laborer was busy

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the clause "asked for a tool." The antecedent of "she" must be the person who is asking for a tool. Given that "the secretary" is the only female noun in the sentence preceding the pronoun, and the action of asking for a tool is being attributed to "she," it is clear that "she" refers to the secretary.

So the correct antecedent is:
(B) The secretary asked for a tool

Therefore, the answer is (B), not (C) because there is no ambiguity regarding the antecedent of the pronoun "she."

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second part of the clause, which comes after the conjunction "that". To determine the antecedent of "she," we need to look at the subject of the main clause before the conjunction. The main clause is "The visitor told the teacher," so the antecedent of "she" must be the person doing the telling, which is "the visitor."

Therefore, the correct antecedent is "The visitor," and the answer is:

(A) The visitor liked the cake. 

The sentence does not suggest that the teacher liked the cake, as "she" refers back to the visitor, not the teacher. The ambiguity here is resolved by the context provided by the main clause.
 98%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▋ | 246/250 [2:07:08<02:06, 31.68s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female subject, we can look at the options to see if there's a female character that fits the context.

The sentence states, "The chief told the counselor that _ took the day off." Here, the chief is a potential antecedent for "she," as it could be the chief taking the day off, but it's less common for a chief to use "she" to refer to themselves. On the other hand, "the counselor" is a more plausible antecedent, as it is a person and "she" would make sense to refer to a female counselor.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" in this context is most likely the counselor, making option (B) the correct choice.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "needed to get more rest." We need to determine whether "he" refers to the surgeon or the patient. Since the surgeon is the one warning the patient, it is logical that the surgeon would be the one giving advice about needing more rest. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" in this context is the patient.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The patient needed more rest

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context is that the technician is communicating with the customer, so "he" must be referring to one of them. Since the sentence suggests that the action of paying with cash is being discussed, it is more likely that the person who can perform this action is being referred to. Therefore, the pronoun "he" is most likely referring to the subject who is capable of paying.

Given that the technician is telling the customer this, it is logical that "he" refers to the customer, as the technician is informing them of their payment options. Thus, the correct antecedent is:

(B) The customer could pay

So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is used after "gave," which implies that "them" refers to the subject that received the action of giving. Since the subject "the housekeeper" comes immediately before "and gave," it is logical to assume that "them" refers back to the housekeeper. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is the housekeeper.

The correct answer is (B) Gave the housekeeper some tips.
