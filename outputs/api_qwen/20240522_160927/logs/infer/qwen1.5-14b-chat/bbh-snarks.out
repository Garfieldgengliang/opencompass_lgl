Option (A) describes someone as generous for promoting a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need, which is a positive action and aligns with the adjective "generous." 

Option (B) describes someone as a "terrible person" for the same action, which contradicts the positive outcome of raising millions for a good cause. Using the term "terrible" in this context would imply that the act of promoting the charity is actually bad despite its positive impact, which is a sarcastic way of expressing disdain for someone who is doing something praiseworthy.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
  1%|▍                                                                                      | 1/178 [00:48<2:23:15, 48.56s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that the person should simply be happy to avoid depression, implying that happiness is a solution to the problem of depression. However, the statement itself doesn't directly imply sarcasm, as it could be genuinely offering advice.

Option (B) rephrases the suggestion from (A) but adds a sarcastic tone by placing "Hey just be happy" at the beginning, which gives it a more dismissive or mocking connotation. The phrase "that you won't be depressed anymore" implies that the suggestion to be happy is trivializing the person's struggle with depression, making it seem like it's an easy fix when it might not be.

Based on this analysis, the statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because of the added sarcastic tone in the opening phrase.

Therefore, the answer is (B).
  1%|▉                                                                                      | 2/178 [01:32<2:14:21, 45.80s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider sarcasm, the statement should convey a meaning opposite to what is being said. 

In (A), the phrase "that's what keeps it okay" implies that making memes about racism is acceptable, which is not the typical view on racism. It's a sarcastic way of saying that engaging in such behavior is not actually acceptable.

In (B), the phrase "that's what keeps it toxic" suggests that making memes about racism contributes to a negative environment, which aligns with the general understanding that racism is harmful and should not be normalized or joked about.

Given this analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement, as it suggests the opposite of what is commonly believed about racism and memes.

So, the answer is (A).
  2%|█▍                                                                                     | 3/178 [02:25<2:23:23, 49.16s/it]================================================================================================================================
The statement (A) suggests that allowing someone to get away after being assaulted is not a reasonable response, as if the speaker believes the person should have taken action against the attackers. This is likely sarcastic, as in many situations, letting the assailants go would not be a desirable outcome.

On the other hand, (B) directly contradicts the idea that the person should have allowed the assaulters to escape, stating that the suggestion is correct. This statement is not sarcastic, as it is supportive of taking action in response to an assault.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
  2%|█▉                                                                                     | 4/178 [03:05<2:11:58, 45.51s/it]================================================================================================================================
Both (A) and (B) suggest that the difference between what was said and what might have been perceived as a threat is minimal, with (A) emphasizing the word "totally" to imply that the distinction being drawn is not significant, and (B) does the same with "totally different" but uses "pleaded" instead of "urged."

In both cases, the use of "totally" to downplay the difference could indicate sarcasm, as if the speaker is suggesting that the distinction between urging and threatening is negligible, and the act was still aggressive or menacing.

Given that both options present a similar sarcastic tone, either can be considered sarcastic, but since (A) uses a stronger emphasis on the word "totally," it might come across as more overtly sarcastic.

Therefore, the most sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
  3%|██▍                                                                                    | 5/178 [03:45<2:05:04, 43.38s/it]================================================================================================================================
Both (A) and (B) express surprise at using unconventional takeout containers (hardwood or plastic). However, when we consider sarcasm, the choice is likely to be the one that is unexpected or unlikely in a positive context.

In the case of (A), using hardwood containers for takeout is highly unusual and might be considered environmentally unsustainable or impractical. If the speaker is being sarcastic, they would be highlighting the absurdity of such an occurrence.

In (B), using plastic containers is much more common for takeout meals, so it is less surprising and less likely to be a source of sarcasm.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
  3%|██▉                                                                                    | 6/178 [04:47<2:22:35, 49.74s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we analyze both options:

(A) Suggests that poverty is easily avoidable or that the person should simply stop being poor, which is a clear exaggeration, as overcoming poverty is generally not a simple task. This statement implies the opposite of what it says, making it sarcastic.

(B) Recommends not being rude, which is a straightforward piece of advice that doesn't inherently contain any irony or sarcasm. It could be a genuine suggestion.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A).

So the answer is (A).
  4%|███▍                                                                                   | 7/178 [05:28<2:13:43, 46.92s/it]================================================================================================================================
The statement (A) suggests replacing trams with carriages, which implies a return to a less efficient or outdated mode of transportation. This could be seen as a sarcastic suggestion if the speaker believes trams are a better option and is mocking the idea of going back to carriages.

On the other hand, statement (B) proposes replacing trams with light rail, which is a more modern and often considered a step up from trams in terms of efficiency and sustainability. This statement does not inherently imply sarcasm, as it presents a potentially reasonable alternative.

Based on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic than (B). So the answer is (A).
  4%|███▉                                                                                   | 8/178 [06:16<2:14:28, 47.46s/it]================================================================================================================================
In (A), the speaker is referring to someone who has started drinking every day, and calling it a "great transformation." Given that drinking regularly is generally not considered a positive lifestyle change, the use of sarcasm is likely here as the speaker is implying that the change is actually negative.

In (B), the speaker mentions someone who has been exercising daily, and describes it as a "great transformation." Exercise is typically seen as a positive habit that leads to a healthier lifestyle, so the statement is more straightforward and does not seem sarcastic.

Based on the context, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).
  5%|████▍                                                                                  | 9/178 [07:06<2:15:17, 48.03s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we look at (A), it states that being over six feet automatically means someone must be tall. This is a straightforward statement that directly connects height with the descriptor "tall," so it is not sarcastic.

However, in (B), the statement says that being over six feet implies the person must be wonderful. This is a non-trivial connection, as height does not necessarily correlate with someone being wonderful. In fact, it is an unexpected and exaggerated claim, which suggests a hint of irony or sarcasm, as it goes against the typical expectations.

Based on these considerations, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).
  6%|████▊                                                                                 | 10/178 [07:59<2:18:41, 49.53s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) says "Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef," which implies that working in a restaurant, which could be any restaurant, has led to impressive culinary skills. This might not be entirely sarcastic, as some people can gain valuable cooking experience from restaurant work.

However, Option (B) specifies "McDonald's," which is a fast-food chain known for its standardized, quick meals rather than high-quality cuisine. Saying "Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef" would likely be considered sarcastic because it's expected that someone working at a fast-food chain wouldn't necessarily develop exceptional culinary expertise.

Based on this reasoning, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (B). So the answer is (B).
  6%|█████▎                                                                                | 11/178 [08:57<2:25:09, 52.15s/it]================================================================================================================================
If the game is indeed over after the second half, then (A) would be a factual statement, not sarcastic. However, if the statement implies that the game should logically be over after only the first half, considering standard football or similar sports rules, where the second half follows the first, then (A) becomes sarcastic because it is suggesting an absurdity.

In this case, (B) would not be sarcastic as it would be a normal expectation for a game to be over after its first half, unless there's a specific context that makes it sarcastic.

Given the assumption that (A) is making a joke about the situation being illogical, it is the sarcastic option. So the answer is (A).
  7%|█████▊                                                                                | 12/178 [09:39<2:15:38, 49.03s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that conveys the opposite meaning of what is being said, often to mock or criticize.

In this case, if we assume that anarchism is not typically taught as a prime example of a governing system, then:

(A) "Yeah, anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system" would be sarcastic because it implies that anarchism is commonly taught when, in reality, it usually isn't.

On the other hand, (B) "Yeah, democracy is taught as a prime example of a governing system" would be a straightforward statement, as democracy is indeed a common subject in discussions about governance.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
  7%|██████▎                                                                               | 13/178 [10:26<2:13:32, 48.56s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that has the opposite intended meaning, often with a tone of humor or irony. In the context of gourmet sophistication, salt is generally not considered a luxury or exclusive ingredient, whereas caviar is often associated with high-end dining and luxury.

In (A), saying "salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication" would likely be seen as a joke or exaggeration, given that salt is a common and everyday condiment, not typically associated with gourmet food.

On the other hand, (B) states "Everyone knows caviar is the highlight of gourmet sophistication," which is a more accurate reflection of the status of caviar in gourmet cuisine.

Based on this analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement because it implies that salt, a basic ingredient, is the pinnacle of gourmet sophistication, which is not the case. 

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the typical experience of working in retail, pushing a trolley of returns around the store would likely be seen as a tedious or burdensome task, especially if it's referred to as "one of the worst things." Therefore, if the statement is sarcastic, it would imply that the task is actually enjoyable, which contradicts the typical perception.

Option (B) directly contradicts the expected sentiment, suggesting that pushing a trolley of returns is enjoyable, which is an unusual and unlikely claim, hence making it more likely to be sarcastic.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B). The answer is (B).
  8%|███████▏                                                                              | 15/178 [12:08<2:14:06, 49.37s/it]================================================================================================================================
Sarcasm often involves saying something that is the opposite of what is expected or believed to be true. In this case, the statement should convey the opposite meaning.

In (A), the statement suggests that fighting on the stronger/larger and better regimented force's terms is the best way to defeat them, which would imply that the conventional wisdom is accurate or even advisable. This doesn't seem to be sarcastic.

In contrast, (B) suggests that fighting on your own terms is the best strategy, which goes against the assumption that the larger and better-regulated force has an advantage. This implies that the standard approach is not effective and might be seen as a non-traditional or unconventional way to win, which could be a form of sarcasm if the speaker believes that fighting on their terms is actually more effective.

Based on the analysis, (B) is the more likely sarcastic option, as it challenges the conventional wisdom and implies that the usual strategy is flawed.

So the answer is (B).
  9%|███████▋                                                                              | 16/178 [13:04<2:19:02, 51.50s/it]================================================================================================================================
When evaluating these statements for sarcasm, we need to consider the typical expectations around being "great relationship material." If someone is drunk, it usually implies poor judgment, communication, and stability, which are generally not desirable qualities in a partner.

In (A), the statement "He's such terrible relationship material when he's drunk" directly contradicts the desired traits for a good relationship, suggesting that being drunk is a negative aspect for someone's relationship prospects, which is a straightforward observation.

In contrast, (B) says "He's such great relationship material when he's drunk," which is the opposite of what would normally be expected. It implies that being drunk is a positive trait for relationship compatibility, which is an unusual and unlikely claim, especially if the speaker is being sarcastic.

Therefore, the statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it is expressing the opposite of what is typically considered a desirable quality in a partner.

Answer: (B)

If we consider the context, a sarcastic statement would imply the opposite of what is being said, especially if the situation is exaggerated for comedic effect.

(A) In this statement, the speaker expresses disappointment about their expensive phone's battery life but suggests returning it instead of simply accepting the issue. While it might be frustrating, it doesn't sound overly sarcastic.

(B) In contrast, when the speaker suggests they'll "just have to dumpster" the expensive phone, it implies that the phone is worthless now, even though it's a $1000 device. This is a more extreme and exaggerated response, suggesting that the speaker doesn't actually intend to throw it away but is using hyperbole to express their dissatisfaction. This could be interpreted as sarcastic.

Based on this analysis, (B) is the more likely sarcastic statement.

Answer: (B)
 10%|████████▋                                                                             | 18/178 [14:51<2:21:34, 53.09s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) states that the website is a "rock-solid source" despite being well-known for posting falsehoods and spreading false rumors. The term "rock-solid" is often used to describe something that is solid and reliable, which is the opposite of a source that spreads misinformation. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic because it presents an absurdity by praising a source that is known to be unreliable.

On the other hand, Option (B) calls the website a "suspicious source," which is a more straightforward and accurate assessment given the information provided. It does not contain the same irony as (A).

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
 11%|█████████▏                                                                            | 19/178 [15:46<2:22:01, 53.59s/it]================================================================================================================================
In the context of the definition of sarcasm, which involves saying something that means the opposite or implies a negative when a positive is expected, let's analyze each statement:

(A) "Violence is a perfect way to unleash your frustrations" - If someone were to say this sincerely, they would likely be advocating for violence as a solution, which is generally not considered a positive or healthy way to manage frustrations. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic because it implies the opposite, that violence is not a good way to handle frustrations.

(B) "Exercise is a perfect way to unleash your frustrations" - Exercise is generally known to be a positive and healthy way to manage stress and frustration. If someone said this, they would likely be expressing a genuine opinion, not sarcasm.

Based on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is (A).
 11%|█████████▋                                                                            | 20/178 [16:31<2:14:24, 51.04s/it]================================================================================================================================
In both options, the speaker is expressing difficulty with a task related to technology. However, when discussing a "printer" in (A), it is an outdated technology compared to a "microprocessor," which is a core component of modern computers and more complex.

Sarcasm often involves using a statement that is the opposite of what is meant, or making a light-hearted joke at the expense of something perceived as easy or simple. Given this context, if the speaker finds working with a microprocessor complex, it is more likely that they are using sarcasm, as it is a common understanding that microprocessors are much more advanced and intricate than printers.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B). Working the microprocessor is too complex for me.
 12%|██████████▏                                                                           | 21/178 [17:14<2:07:10, 48.60s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that the world does not need more children with trust issues and psychological problems, which implies that the speaker believes the situation is already problematic. However, the phrase "no world needs" is actually a double negative, which can sometimes be used for emphasis or sarcasm, as it sounds like the speaker is suggesting that the world does, in fact, desperately need more of these issues.

Option (B), on the other hand, directly states that the world needs more kids with these problems, which is the opposite of what a sarcastic statement would imply.

Based on the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because of the use of the double negative, while (B) appears to be a straightforward statement.

So, the answer is (A).
 12%|██████████▋                                                                           | 22/178 [18:13<2:14:25, 51.70s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider the context, Knuth's up arrow notation is a well-known mathematical concept, and referring to its familiarity would not usually be met with sarcasm. In (A), the speaker is likely asking if the listener is not familiar with it, but not expressing disbelief or derision.

However, in (B), the use of the word "normal" implies that the speaker expects the listener to find the notation commonplace, which is unlikely to be the case for most people outside of mathematics or computer science. Using "normal" in this context might be a subtle form of sarcasm, suggesting that the speaker finds it surprising that someone isn't more familiar with it.

Given the options and the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic.

So the answer is (B).
 13%|███████████                                                                           | 23/178 [18:52<2:03:36, 47.85s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we look at (A), the statement suggests that since it's the first week of winter, it's logical to expect the weather to get warmer in a few weeks for a playoff game. This is not a sarcastic statement because it is acknowledging the typical progression of seasons.

On the other hand, (B) states that it's the last week of winter, yet the speaker is still expecting it to get warmer in a couple of weeks for the playoff game. Given that it's the last week of winter, it would be highly unlikely for the temperature to suddenly increase. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic because it defies logic and is meant to imply that the speaker doesn't believe the claim.

So the sarcastic option is (B).

The statement (A) suggests that the act of sneaking out dangerous contraband from a government facility is difficult, which is a straightforward observation, and doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.

On the other hand, statement (B) says that sneaking out dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal, which is a direct contradiction of the expected outcome, as it implies that the act would be acceptable despite its nature, which could be seen as a sarcastic way of pointing out how absurd or illogical the situation might be.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
 14%|████████████                                                                          | 25/178 [21:08<2:27:28, 57.84s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider the context of the statement, sarcasm usually implies a statement that is meant to convey the opposite of its literal meaning, especially when the situation would actually be negative if the statement were true.

In (A), the statement suggests that it's fortunate that prices haven't increased significantly since eight years ago, which is generally not a good thing, especially if inflation or rising costs are a concern. Thus, if someone were to express this sentiment sarcastically, they might be pointing out how unfortunate it is that prices have remained high.

In (B), the comparison between eight days ago and now might seem less significant, as a shorter time frame could imply that a small increase in prices might be expected or acceptable. It's less likely that this statement would be seen as sarcastic because it doesn't necessarily imply the opposite of what is said.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a negative situation in a seemingly positive light.

So the answer is (A).
 15%|████████████▌                                                                         | 26/178 [21:59<2:21:43, 55.94s/it]================================================================================================================================
Here, the statement is sarcastic when it describes something as "endangered" that is not actually in danger, as a way to mock or express irony. In this context, "elephants" are real-life endangered species, while "trolls" are typically used metaphorically to refer to internet users who provoke conflict or argue for no constructive purpose.

In (A), the speaker is sarcastically referring to feeding elephants, which is a genuine concern, and contrasting it with the "woefully endangered" status, which is a misrepresentation.

In (B), the speaker is using the same structure to describe "trolls" as an endangered species, which is a clear exaggeration and a jab at the idea that trolls are deserving of concern like actual endangered animals.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).

Based on these examples, the answer is:

(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.

If we consider sarcasm, the statement should convey the opposite meaning of what it directly says while pretending to be serious.

In (A), the speaker claims that blocking the river is a "smart move" when it implies that without the river, there's no water and electricity, which would be detrimental. Sarcasm would suggest that blocking it is actually a foolish decision, not a smart one.

In (B), the speaker calls blocking the river a "terrible move," which aligns with the expected outcome of cutting off water and electricity. Here, the statement is straightforward and not sarcastic.

Given the analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement because it presents the opposite sentiment of what is logically expected.

So the answer is (A).

Both (A) and (B) express sympathy for someone who has worked hard but received a relatively small scholarship. However, when comparing the amounts ($50,000 vs $50), the disparity is much greater in (A) than in (B). The larger amount in (A) makes the statement seem more exaggerated, which is a common technique in sarcasm.

In the context of sarcasm, if someone were genuinely surprised by a $50,000 scholarship, they might express their disbelief in a sarcastic manner by making it sound like a paltry sum. Therefore, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because of the implied irony in downplaying a significant amount.

So the answer is (A).

Option (A) suggests that the cost of $0.15 per mile for a van is considered reasonable fuel costs. Given that most people would expect fuel costs to be significantly higher than $0.15 per mile, especially for a van, this statement appears to be making an exaggeratedly low estimate to imply that the cost is unreasonable, which is a form of sarcasm.

On the other hand, Option (B) suggests a much higher cost of $10 per mile, which might be considered reasonable by some depending on factors like the size of the van, fuel efficiency, and market conditions. This statement doesn't inherently have the same level of irony or sarcasm as (A).

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the context of the statement about leaving useless space junk in orbit, if someone is doing it "just because they can," it implies a lack of concern for the environment or responsible behavior. In (A), the phrase "What a horrible person" suggests that the speaker disapproves of this action, making it sarcastic because the person is being labeled negatively for an irresponsible act.

On the other hand, in (B), the phrase "What a brilliant person" is contradictory, as leaving space junk is generally not considered a brilliant decision. The use of "brilliant" in this context is sarcastic because it is meant to mock or ridicule the person's actions.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B). The answer is (B).

Option (A) states, "I earn money for winning? Sign me up!" This implies enthusiasm and eagerness for a situation where winning results in financial gain, which is a typical positive outcome, so it does not sound sarcastic.

Option (B) says, "I lose money for winning? Sign me up!" This statement is unusual because it suggests that winning would lead to financial loss, which is generally the opposite of what one would expect. By expressing excitement to sign up for such a situation, the speaker is using irony or sarcasm, as it is not a desirable outcome.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

(A) implies that being wealthy is a necessary condition for accessing healthy food, which is not necessarily true, as healthy food can often be affordable to people from various income levels. The statement seems to exaggerate the financial barrier to healthy eating, which aligns with the definition of sarcasm.

(B) directly contradicts (A) by stating that non-rich people can also afford healthy food, which is a more realistic statement.

Given the options and the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an exaggerated and unrealistic claim, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning. In this case, the word "classy" is used sarcastically when describing an action that is typically seen as unprofessional or rude.

Looking at (A), the statement "I love it when people mock other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy" suggests that mocking others is considered classy, which is the opposite of what a typical understanding of the term "classy" would imply. So, this is a sarcastic statement.

On the other hand, (B) says "I love it when people encourage other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy," which implies that encouragement is seen as a classy behavior, which aligns with the common understanding of the term "classy."

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

When comparing the two statements, the key difference lies in the degree of wobbling described: "several millimeters" in (A) and "several feet" in (B). Millimeters are a very small measurement, while feet are significantly larger. If someone were to say that even a small wobble of several millimeters indicates safety concerns, it would seem to be an exaggeration or an unusual perspective, which could imply sarcasm.

In contrast, a large wobble of several feet would generally be considered a clear indication of a bike being unsafe, and not sarcastic.

Given this analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the exaggerated nature of the claim. So the answer is (A).

The difference between the two statements lies in the length of the wait mentioned. In (A), the wait is only two minutes, which is a very short period, and suggesting leaving over such a minor inconvenience might be considered an exaggeration or a sarcastic remark because it's unlikely someone would leave for such a short wait time. 

In (B), the wait is two hours, which is significantly longer, and it's more reasonable to expect someone might consider leaving in such a situation.

Therefore, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (A), as it understates the inconvenience for comedic effect or to express disbelief at the inconvenience caused by such a short wait.

Answer: (A)

(A) The phrase "Hey genocide is clearly the most rational decision" is highly unlikely to be a sincere statement, given that genocide is widely recognized as a horrific and immoral act, not a rational one. It uses the word "clearly" to emphasize the absurdity of the claim, making it sarcastic.

(B) On the other hand, "Hey compromise is clearly the most rational decision" might be seen as a genuine statement if the context supports the idea that compromising is generally considered a rational course of action. Without additional context, it could be either sincere or sarcastic, depending on the situation.

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the inherent contradiction between the term "rational" and the act of genocide.

If we analyze both options:

(A) The statement "He's just kindhearted. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!" suggests that being kindhearted is a positive quality for running a country, even if it might not be the only relevant factor. The sarcasm comes from the fact that it implies that kindness alone should not determine someone's fitness to lead, but the speaker is using sarcasm to imply that it is a questionable qualification.

(B) "He's just demented. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!" directly states that someone is demented, which is a serious mental health issue, and then sarcastically suggests that it's perfectly fine for them to run the country. The statement implies that the person's mental state is not a concern, which is obviously not the case.

Given these analyses, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

The statement is sarcastic when it uses an expected response to express the opposite meaning. In this case, if someone were truly dedicated to earning minutes, they wouldn't be described as having 'lackluster play' and taking time out to grab hot dogs during halftime.

(A) States that the person is apathetic, which is the opposite of being dedicated, because their actions (lack of effort and eating hot dogs) don't align with the goal of earning minutes.

(B) Claims the opposite, that the person is dedicated despite their lack of performance and the unprofessional behavior.

Based on the context, (B) is sarcastic because it is saying the exact opposite of what it implies, making fun of the person's actions.

So the answer is (B).

Both (A) and (B) express skepticism or disbelief about an NFL head coach with a losing record who hasn't been on the field in ten years. However, (A) uses the phrase "this is gonna go great," which is an unexpected positive outcome for a situation that usually implies a poor performance. In contrast, (B) uses "this is gonna go terribly," which is a straightforward prediction of a negative outcome.

Given that sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (A) because it's suggesting a positive outcome for an unfavorable situation, which is unlikely and hence a form of sarcasm.

So, the answer is (A).

Option (A) states that protein supplements are more expensive than $1 breakfast gruel. Given that protein supplements are generally more expensive than basic food items like gruel, this statement could be true, especially if the gruel is very cheap. There's no clear sarcasm in this comparison.

Option (B) also compares protein supplements to breakfast burritos, but a breakfast burrito is a more substantial meal that might include proteins, making it a more reasonable comparison for the cost of protein supplements. However, the statement doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm; it could simply be a comparison based on price.

Comparing the two options, neither seems to be overtly sarcastic, but (A) might be slightly more ambiguous due to the simplicity of the comparison. If we consider sarcasm to be present when the statement is intended to convey the opposite meaning, (A) could be seen as sarcastic because it implies that something as cheap as gruel should cost as much as protein supplements, which is unlikely.

Given the available information, I would lean towards interpreting (A) as the more sarcastic choice, but without further context, it's not a definitive conclusion. If sarcasm was the intended tone, the answer would be (A).

The key to identifying sarcasm in this case is the incongruity between the statement and the expected behavior. In both options, the speaker is expressing disbelief in a 7-time felon who has just committed murder. However, the difference lies in the tone and the implied meaning.

In (A), the speaker explicitly states their disbelief but then contradicts themselves by saying they "don't believe" the murderer wouldn't lie. This is a form of sarcasm, as it implies that the speaker actually expects the felon to be truthful, which is highly unlikely given their record.

In (B), the statement is more straightforward and consistent with the idea that a murderer might not be believed. There's no irony or contradiction that suggests sarcasm.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In both options, the speaker is exaggerating the situation to express frustration or disbelief. However, the difference lies in the severity of the consequence.

(A) Implies that the email pile-up will only become a "server threatening issue," which is a more technical term and less dramatic than a "life threatening issue."

(B) Suggests that the email count going off the screen would result in a life-threatening situation, which is an extreme exaggeration and implies a level of sarcasm.

So, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (B) because of the dramatic and unrealistic outcome it implies.

If we look at (A), the scenario described is that of a fire, which typically does not involve any threat of violence. Having weapons drawn in response to a fire call would be unusual and contrary to the usual protocol, making it seem like a sarcastic comment on the overreaction or lack of judgment.

On the other hand, (B) refers to a scene of a shooting, which is a situation where weapons drawn would be entirely expected and appropriate for the safety of the responders.

Based on the context, the sarcastic tone is more likely in (A), as it questions the logic of having weapons drawn in a non-threatening situation.

So, the answer is (A).

Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a mocking or ironic tone. In the context of wars, it is well-known that people often initiate conflicts for reasons such as acquiring or asserting control over territory.

Option (A) states, "People never foment wars to relinquish territory," which implies that people never start wars to give up land. This directly contradicts the historical reality, as wars can sometimes result from a desire to cede territory.

Option (B) says, "People never foment wars to conquer territory," which also seems to imply that conquest is not a motivation for war. This is another example of a statement that directly contradicts common knowledge, as territorial expansion has been a driving force in many conflicts throughout history.

Given the context, both options are sarcastic because they present a negation of a well-recognized reason for war, while suggesting that such actions are unheard of. However, since (A) explicitly states the opposite of what is commonly known (people do often fight for territory), it might be slightly more overtly sarcastic than (B). 

Answer: (A) People never foment wars to relinquish territory.

Both options present a sarcastic tone, as they express the opposite of what is expected. In both cases, the phrase "let's crucify" implies strong disapproval or criticism, while the act of making money is a common and expected behavior for a nonprofit or a company.

In (A), the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the official mission of a nonprofit organization (typically to serve a cause rather than profit) and the suggestion that crucifying them for making money is appropriate. It implies that the nonprofit should not be criticized for its financial success.

In (B), the same logic applies to a company, which is generally expected to make money. By suggesting crucifying the company for doing so, the speaker is being sarcastic.

So, both statements are sarcastic, but if we must choose one, (A) might be slightly more sarcastic since it refers to a nonprofit, which is less associated with profit-making than a company. However, the degree of sarcasm could be perceived similarly in both cases.

Answer: Both (A) and (B) are sarcastic.

The statement (A) says that despite paying for Amazon Prime, which includes free shipping, the customer consistently receives delayed, damaged, non-functioning, and wrong items. The use of "So disappointed" indicates dissatisfaction, which contradicts the benefit of free shipping. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic.

On the other hand, statement (B) says the same negative aspects but ends with "So happy I pay for free shipping with Prime," which is an unusual expression of happiness given the poor experience described. This statement is also sarcastic because it is presenting a situation of dissatisfaction as if it were a positive outcome.

Both (A) and (B) are sarcastic, but the question asks for only one. Since (B) has a more exaggerated and clear indication of sarcasm with the word "happy," we choose (B).

Option (A) suggests that America's freedom is protected by democracy, which is a political system, which might be a valid argument for some people. While it could be seen as a critique of the reliance on democracy alone for protection, it doesn't inherently carry a sarcastic tone.

Option (B) states that America is more free because they have guns, implying that armed citizens are responsible for ensuring their freedom, which is an unconventional and possibly exaggerated claim. This could be seen as a sarcastic or ironic remark because it implies that having access to firearms is a primary means of safeguarding personal liberty, which is not a typical understanding of freedom.

Given the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an unlikely or exaggerated explanation for freedom.

Option (A) states that those who make more money are inherently better, which directly contradicts the common societal critique that wealth does not determine moral superiority. This kind of statement is often used sarcastically to mock or challenge the idea that financial success equates to moral worth.

Option (B), on the other hand, says that those who make more money aren't inherently better, which is a more neutral or even agreeable statement, as it aligns with the idea that wealth does not determine a person's goodness.

The statement (A) suggests that simply eating healthy meals would not be enough to meet the demands of an active lifestyle, which implies that the speaker thinks there might be more to maintaining an active lifestyle than just diet. This statement could be seen as sarcastic if the speaker is actually implying that the person is overestimating the importance of healthy meals or underestimating the effort required for an active lifestyle.

On the other hand, (B) directly states that healthy meals are sufficient for an active lifestyle, which seems like a straightforward and non-sarcastic statement.

Option (A) states, "Impossible, as there's no one on the internet." In reality, the internet is teeming with users, making this claim sarcastic because it's a well-known fact that millions of people are constantly using the internet.

Option (B) says, "Impossible, as there's no one on the Moon." This statement could be interpreted as a humorous exaggeration or a play on the fact that, historically, there were no continuous human presence on the Moon. While it may not be entirely sarcastic, it does contain a touch of irony, as it's not impossible for there to be no one on the Moon at a given moment, but the statement implies it's highly unlikely.

The statement (A) suggests that if something hasn't happened before, it must not be part of the law, which is a clear exaggeration and implies that the speaker finds the idea absurd. The use of sarcasm is evident here, as the speaker is likely implying that the lack of a precedent doesn't automatically mean it's not covered by the law.

On the other hand, statement (B) also mentions that it hasn't happened before, but instead of suggesting it's not in the lawbooks, it suggests it's not against the lawbooks, which might be a subtle distinction, but it doesn't necessarily carry the same level of sarcasm as (A).

Option (A) says "Yeah, the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to suffer." This implies that the presence of these issues is negatively impacting the speaker, which aligns with the expected meaning of sarcasm.

On the other hand, Option (B) says "Yeah, the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to thrive." This statement suggests that the presence of these issues is somehow beneficial to the speaker, which goes against the typical meaning of sarcasm when discussing problems.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, usually to mock or ridicule. 

In (A), the statement "diamonds are worthless" directly contradicts the common perception that diamonds are highly valued for their rarity and beauty, making it a sarcastic remark if the speaker is implying that they are not worth much at all.

In (B), the statement "diamonds are valuable" aligns with the typical understanding of diamonds as a precious gem, so it does not convey sarcasm.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the definition of sarcasm, we expect a statement that implies the opposite of what it says while using humor or irony. 

Option (A) states, "Because women are totally incapable of doing everyday tasks like pumping gas without a partner taking over and doing it for her." This implies that women are helpless in such situations, which is the opposite of the reality, where women are generally capable of performing these tasks independently. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic.

Option (B) directly affirms women's capability, which is in line with the truth, and does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The statement (A) suggests that people buy insurance because of the likelihood of a riot, which is an unusual and unlikely reason for purchasing insurance, as insurance typically covers events like accidents, illnesses, or damages, not civil unrest. The use of "right" here is sarcastic because it's clear that the speaker is pointing out how absurd the idea is.

On the other hand, (B) states that people buy insurance based on the possibility of an accident, which is a reasonable and common reason for insurance. It aligns with the typical purpose of insurance.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) suggests banning breathing, which is an essential function for human survival. It is an absurd idea, and suggesting such a thing would generally be used to express disbelief or sarcasm. 
(B) suggests banning vaping, which is a controversial topic, but not as absurd as banning breathing. It might be seen as a serious proposal, depending on the context.

Given the options, (A) "We should start a petition to ban breathing" stands out as the more extreme and unlikely suggestion, which implies sarcasm due to its illogical nature.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

The question asks for a sarcastic statement. Sarcasm usually involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning, often to mock or criticize.

In (A), the speaker is suggesting that the listener might prefer to engage with bullies who have narcissistic personality disorder, which is a negative trait. This could be sarcastic if the speaker is actually expressing disbelief or disapproval that someone would want to associate with such individuals.

In (B), the speaker is asking if the listener isn't into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder, which implies the opposite of what (A) suggests. If this were sarcastic, the speaker would be suggesting that they find it surprising that someone wouldn't be attracted to such individuals.

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a seemingly absurd preference, which is a common technique in sarcasm. Therefore, the answer is (A).
 33%|████████████████████████████▌                                                         | 59/178 [47:59<1:35:08, 47.97s/it]================================================================================================================================
In the context of cultural appropriation, it refers to the misappropriation or exploitation of elements from one culture by members of another culture, often without proper understanding or respect for its significance. Therefore, if someone were to describe something as "cultural appropriation at its finest," they would likely be expressing dissatisfaction or irony, as it implies that the situation is not a positive example of cultural exchange but rather a negative one.

On the other hand, "It's cultural celebration at its finest!" would suggest a genuine appreciation and celebration of different cultures.

Based on this reasoning, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

In the context of the discussion about free speech, the idea that corporate money can equate to free speech is often seen as a criticism, because it implies that wealthy corporations may wield undue influence over the political process. If the statement is meant to express that this situation is a victory for democracy, it would be doing so ironically or sarcastically.

Therefore, (B) is the sarcastic statement because it presents the reverse logic, suggesting that something that undermines the equal voice of citizens (by allowing corporations to spend more) is a triumph for democracy.

The answer is (B).

In (A), the statement implies that the graphics guy was unproductive, spending most of his time on non-work-related activities, and describes the employees as "always the laziest." This suggests that the speaker is critical of the employee's behavior and is not praising them, which is sarcastic.

In contrast, (B) describes the same situation but uses an opposite adjective, "best," to describe the employees. This would seem to be an unexpected compliment if the speaker is genuinely concerned about the employees' productivity, making it a sarcastic remark as well.

Therefore, both (A) and (B) are sarcastic statements, but since the task asks for only one, either could be chosen. If we must choose one, we might lean towards (A) because it is more straightforwardly critical and mocking the employees' laziness.

Answer: (A)

The sarcastic tone is usually used when the speaker is saying something that is the opposite of what they mean, but with a serious or exaggerated expression to imply the opposite.

In (A), the speaker is expressing frustration about not getting enough sleep, which is the opposite of "best." The sarcastic element is present because they are using an overly enthusiastic tone to emphasize their dissatisfaction.

In (B), the speaker is saying that they've had more than enough sleep, which directly contradicts the sarcastic tone they might otherwise use if they were talking about insufficient sleep. Since this statement aligns with the idea of "best" as the speaker suggests, it is not sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

If we consider the context of a late-night vote on a bill written secretly by a single party, a democratic process would involve transparency, open discussion, and equal representation. In this scenario, a statement suggesting that such a process is democratic would be contradictory and ironic.

Looking at the options:
(A) States that the process is "undemocratic," which aligns with the actual lack of democratic principles in the described situation, making it a likely sarcastic statement.
(B) Claims the process is "democratic," which directly contradicts the reality of the secretive and one-sided nature of the vote, suggesting sarcasm.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).

If the game is meant to resemble real life, then it would logically include security cameras at the White House. Therefore, if someone were to say (B), "Of course there's several security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!" it would be a straightforward statement aligning with the expected similarity.

On the other hand, (A) "Of course there's no security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!" contradicts the expected similarity, suggesting that the game does not accurately represent reality. This kind of statement is unexpected if the goal is to emulate real life, making it sarcastic.

(A) Muslims love celebrating Christmas - This statement is unlikely to be true, as Christmas is a primarily Christian holiday, and while some Muslims might appreciate the cultural aspects or engage in interfaith activities, it's not a typical celebration for them.

(B) Muslims love celebrating Eid - This statement is more likely to be true, as Eid is a significant religious festival for Muslims, marking the end of Ramadan or another important event.

Given the context, the statement that would be more likely to be sarcastic would be (A), as it presents a situation that is not consistent with the typical practices of Muslims.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

In both options, the phrase "ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???" is a strong expression of disbelief or sarcasm, suggesting that the speaker finds it absurd that someone would claim to like the system. 

Option (A) suggests giving an up vote for being rational, which is the opposite of what the sarcastic tone implies. It's as if the speaker is saying, "If you're actually rational, I'll give you a negative endorsement."

Option (B) also suggests giving a down vote for being rational, which again goes against the implied disbelief and sarcasm. Here, the speaker is saying, "If you're acting rationally, I'll punish you by not agreeing with you."

Given the context, both options seem sarcastic. However, (B) is more directly sarcastic, as it directly opposes the act of being rational with a downvote.

Therefore, the statement that is most sarcastic is (B). So the answer is (B).

However, (A) suggests that it would actually be a "great" way, which is the opposite of what one would expect in a sincere statement, making it sarcastic.

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, often in a humorous or critical way. In the context of this question, the statement about "taking out and smelling the trash" being a favorite or least-favorite activity is crucial.

If the statement is sarcastic, it would imply that the speaker actually dislikes doing that task, but is using a sarcastic tone to express their displeasure.

Looking at the options:
(A) States that it's a least-favorite thing, which is the opposite of what a person would say if they genuinely enjoyed it. This aligns with the definition of sarcasm.

(B) States that it's a favorite thing, which directly contradicts the idea of sarcasm. If the speaker genuinely likes taking out and smelling the trash, they wouldn't describe it as their favorite task sarcastically.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

Option (A) suggests that being rude and demanding will result in getting "tons of trashy stuff," which implies that the speaker is mocking or making fun of such behavior because it would lead to poor quality or undesirable outcomes.

Option (B) also suggests being rude and demanding but states that it will result in "tons of free stuff," which contradicts the common understanding that such behavior would not typically lead to receiving anything for free. However, the phrase "tons of free stuff" could be seen as a sarcastic exaggeration, suggesting that the speaker knows it's unlikely to happen but is using humor to mock the idea.

Given the context, both options seem to讽刺 the idea of being rude and demanding, but (B) uses a more exaggerated and humorous tone, which might be more overtly sarcastic.

So, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (B). The answer is (B).

Option (B) directly contradicts this logic by suggesting that calling people 'morons' is a great way to win them over. This is clearly the opposite of what a well-reasoned or respectful approach would be, so it is the one that employs sarcasm.

Option (A) suggests that the speaker is surprised by the large number of internships the other person applied to, given the context provided ("only"). If the statement were sincere, it would be an expression of admiration for their effort. However, given that the act of applying to 200 internships in a week is quite substantial, the use of "only" here implies disbelief or sarcasm.

On the other hand, Option (B) also uses "Wow," but it seems more genuine because it is followed by a much smaller number, "2." In this case, if the speaker is genuinely impressed, they might express surprise at such a low number.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) States that armed revolutionaries haven't had a significant impact on middle-class Americans, which is a common sentiment, as revolutions usually imply significant disruptions and changes. If the statement were sincere, it would be unusual for revolutionaries to claim to have made little change. Therefore, this statement could be sarcastic because it implies that the revolutionaries have failed to deliver the expected change.

(B) Directly contradicts (A) by stating that revolutionaries have indeed made a lot of change for the middle class. If taken at face value, it would suggest a situation where revolutionaries have successfully influenced middle-class lives positively, which is less likely to be a sarcastic claim.

If we consider the typical experience of college life, where students often face stress due to assignments, grades, and exams, statement (A) describes the situation as "stressful," which aligns with the common perception of college life. Therefore, (A) is a realistic and likely statement.

On the other hand, statement (B) describes the semester as "fun," which is the opposite of what one would expect from a typical college experience filled with stress. By calling it "fun," the speaker is using sarcasm to express that it hasn't been enjoyable despite the challenges.

If we analyze (A), it seems like a straightforward reminder that there are people living in Antarctica, which is a factual statement. There's no apparent irony or sarcasm in this statement.

On the other hand, (B) "don't forget there are people in suffering" could be interpreted as a sarcastic remark if it's being said in a context where someone is dismissing the importance of acknowledging or addressing the plight of those in need, despite the existence of suffering. In this case, the statement is highlighting the hypocrisy or lack of empathy if someone were to ignore the existence of suffering.

Given the context, (B) seems more likely to be sarcastic, especially if it's being said to express frustration or disbelief at someone's callousness.

So, the answer is (B).

If we consider the context of internet-connected cars, it is generally recognized that there is a significant risk of hacking and remote control, as these vehicles rely on complex software systems that can potentially be exploited by malicious actors. Therefore, a statement suggesting that the likelihood of this happening is "zero" would be highly unlikely and contrary to common knowledge, making it sarcastic.

On the other hand, if a statement says "And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....high," this aligns with the known risks and would not be sarcastic.

Sarcasm usually involves saying something that is the opposite of what one truly means, in a tone or context that implies disbelief or irony. 

In (A), the statement seems to mock the idea that all the excitement and enthusiasm about Bitcoin on the subreddit led to more people investing, as it implies the opposite - that it actually discouraged investment.

In (B), the statement directly contradicts the expected result of such memes and posts, suggesting that they turned people off from investing, which aligns with the typical sarcastic intention.

If we consider the context of the statement, a sarcastic remark would express the opposite of what is being said in a humorous or critical way. 

In (A), the statement suggests that it would have been great to have a person who prepares ahead of time in office, which is a positive quality. If we interpret sarcasm here, it would imply that the current situation is terrible due to the lack of such a person, which is not the literal meaning of the sentence.

In (B), the statement says that it would have been terrible to have a person who prepares ahead of time in office. This directly contrasts with the common perception of a prepared leader, making it seem like a sarcastic comment, as it implies that the current situation is not so bad because of the lack of preparation.

Given the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it expresses the opposite sentiment in a seemingly praising manner.

If we consider the historical context, Buddhism and Christianity have never coexisted in the same region without significant conflict, particularly in regions like ancient China where Buddhism was dominant. Therefore, the statement that the Christian church had a "lock" in Buddhist China would be highly unlikely and would likely be an exaggeration or a joke.

On the other hand, the phrase "had such a struggle" is more plausible, as it aligns with the historical reality of religious tensions between the two faiths.

Given this analysis, the statement (A) is the one that uses an exaggerated and unrealistic claim, suggesting sarcasm, while (B) is a more realistic acknowledgment of the challenges the Christian church might have faced in Buddhist China.

The question asks for a sarcastic statement, which implies that the speaker is actually expressing the opposite sentiment in a humorous or critical manner.

In (A), the speaker is asking how government control of the internet could be bad, but given the nature of the topic (usually associated with concerns about privacy, censorship, and freedom), the implied sentiment is that government control would likely be detrimental.

In (B), the speaker is asking how government control of the internet could be beneficial, which seems to directly align with the expected sentiment, as some might argue that government oversight could have positive aspects like cybersecurity or regulating harmful content.

Based on the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it is questioning the positive aspects of government control, which is usually the concern in discussions about internet control.

(B) On the other hand, stating that pay-to-win gated content is less fun and accessible aligns with the negative view, so it does not have the same sarcastic tone.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Option (A) implies that the speaker is nostalgic about the past, suggesting that they believe people today are too focused on material wealth and lack the simpler times they experienced. By stating that "back in my day we didn't have luxuries," the speaker is likely making a sarcastic remark, as having no luxuries is generally considered a disadvantage rather than something desirable.

Option (B) also suggests nostalgia, but the lack of houses implies a much more severe deprivation than just luxuries. This statement doesn't seem to be sarcastic because the absence of houses would be a serious issue and not something to mock or imply is better.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The statement (A) suggests that it's absurd to believe that any government would ever ban something that fosters innovation, as if such a move goes against the very nature of governments' role in promoting progress. The irony lies in the fact that some governments might indeed implement regulations or bans to protect innovation, for example, by protecting intellectual property or ensuring safety.

On the other hand, (B) states that inventors would never ban anything that kills innovation, which implies that inventors are inherently supportive of innovation and would never self-impose restrictions. This statement might be seen as less sarcastic, as it is more plausible that inventors would be motivated to protect their creations and the process of innovation.

Given the context of sarcasm, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an exaggerated position to highlight the implausibility of the claim.

So the answer is (A).

The given statement is a duplicate of itself, which makes it difficult to determine sarcasm based on the provided information alone. However, if we consider the content, both options (A) and (B) suggest that entering politics is as simple as being outrageous, which is a clear exaggeration and implies the opposite – that getting into politics is not easy and requires more than just being provocative.

Given the context and the intention to highlight the challenge or irony in entering politics, the statement can be interpreted as sarcastic. Therefore, both (A) and (B) are potentially sarcastic, but since there is no distinction between them, we can only choose one.

Answer: Both (A) and (B) can be considered sarcastic, as they convey a sense of irony by suggesting that entering politics is effortless when it is, in fact, not. However, without a second choice that is not sarcastic, we can only pick one. If we must select, we might choose (A) because it is slightly more distinct from its duplicate. So, we'll go with (A).

In both options, the speaker is acknowledging that the team did significant damage and someone else completed the final blow. In (A), the use of "amazing display of team skill" seems to be an ironic compliment, as if to imply that it's not actually impressive for the team to have contributed the most damage, with only one member delivering the final blow, which should highlight individual skill.

In (B), the phrase "amazing display of individual skill" is directly contrasting the context provided, as the team had already done most of the work, making it more likely that the speaker is highlighting that the final blow was indeed a remarkable individual achievement despite the team's prior efforts.

Given the context, the sarcastic statement is (B), as it implies the opposite of what it directly states, making a point about individual skill when the team's involvement should be emphasized.

So the answer is (B).

In both statements, the speaker is expressing a situation where they expect little income while attending college, and they mention a change in policy (removing or adding tax breaks for students) that would affect their financial situation negatively.

In (A), the speaker sarcastically implies that removing tax breaks for students would be helpful, knowing that it would not be beneficial for someone in their situation.

In (B), the speaker directly states that adding tax breaks for students would be helpful, which is a straightforward and non-sarcastic position.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The statement is sarcastic when it says the opposite of what is expected or meant, usually to express the opposite sentiment. 

In (A), the speaker is suggesting that the listener wouldn't be happier if they never helped others, which is the opposite of what one would naturally assume – that helping others brings happiness.

In (B), the speaker is suggesting that the listener would be lonelier if they never helped others. While it might seem contradictory at first, the underlying message could be that helping others fosters connections and reduces loneliness, which is not a contradiction but rather a positive outcome.

Given the context of sarcasm, (A) is the more sarcastic statement because it implies the opposite of what is generally expected – that helping others would lead to unhappiness, rather than happiness.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the context of basketball, a wide open pass at halfcourt typically means a great opportunity for a teammate to score without much defense. In this situation, the obvious choice would indeed be to pass, not shoot, as shooting from halfcourt would be highly unlikely to result in a successful score.

Option (B) directly contradicts the common understanding of the situation, suggesting that passing when there's an open shot is not the obvious choice. This contradiction implies a sarcastic tone, as if the speaker is surprised or mocking someone for suggesting such an unconventional action.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

In both options, the speaker is discussing a hypothetical stock purchase and sale scenario. In (A), the stock was bought at $10.50 and sold at $100, which is a significant profit. The phrase "such profits being made" implies that the speaker is amazed or incredulous at the profit margin, which could be sarcastic if the actual profit was not as impressive as it initially sounds.

In (B), the stock was bought at $1050 and sold at $100, which is an enormous loss, not a profit. The statement would be highly unlikely to be sarcastic since it describes a negative financial outcome.

Given the context, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (A), as it presents a seemingly impressive profit as if it were something trivial or easily achievable, when in reality, the profit would be substantial. 

So the answer is (A).

The context here is about a soccer game where a player might be in a position to be penalized for a foul or rule violation, and "red" usually refers to a red card, a disciplinary action given to a player. 

In (A), the statement suggests that despite the player's focus on the ball, he should not receive a red card, which is a contradiction. The phrase "shouldn't be a red" implies that the player's eyes being on the ball is an excuse, which is sarcastic because focusing on the ball doesn't justify a red card.

In (B), the statement suggests that the player's cleats were on the ball, which could indicate a foul, but then it says "shouldn't be a red," as if the player's footwear being on the ball is a valid reason to avoid a red card, which is unexpected and illogical, but not necessarily sarcastic.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses a seemingly absurd argument to convey the speaker's disbelief or frustration with the situation.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the typical connotations of the words, concrete and stained-glass, we know that concrete is usually associated with functionality and practicality, while stained-glass is associated with aesthetics and beauty due to its colorful and artistic nature.

Option (A) says "Concrete plates. Very beautiful," which is an unexpected combination, as concrete is not typically associated with beauty in the same context as stained-glass. This statement might be interpreted as sarcastic because it presents an implausible scenario.

Option (B) says "Stained-glass plates. Very beautiful," which directly aligns with the expected beauty of stained-glass, so it would not be considered sarcastic.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the given scenario, the speaker is stating that their laptop stopped working after being submerged in water, and they attribute the failure to either Asus (a brand) or themselves. 

Option (A) implies that Asus is responsible for the malfunction even though it is a common understanding that bringing a device underwater would damage it regardless of the brand, which is an exaggerated or illogical claim, suggesting sarcasm.

Option (B) implies that the speaker accepts responsibility for the laptop's failure, which is a straightforward and logical conclusion given the circumstances, so it doesn't exhibit sarcasm.

In both options, the phrase "I for one am shocked" is used to express sarcasm. If a team is losing to a team with a terrible record, it would be expected and not shocking, so (A) is sarcastic because the speaker is being ironic about the situation being unexpected.

On the other hand, if they're losing to a team with a winning record, that is generally unexpected, so the statement could be genuine shock. However, if the speaker uses sarcasm, they are probably highlighting how absurd it is for a strong team to lose, making (B) sarcastic as well.

So, both (A) and (B) can be sarcastic depending on the tone and context, but (A) is more straightforwardly sarcastic based on the information provided.

A: Both (A) and (B) can be sarcastic, but (A) is more likely to be sarcastic without additional context.

In this case, we are comparing someone to Hitler, who is widely recognized as a brutal dictator and a symbol of evil. Comparing someone to Hitler is often used to express disdain, criticism, or sarcasm, as it implies negative qualities.

Option (A) states, "Just like Hitler. A True warrior." The term "True warrior" is likely being used sarcastically here, given the historical context of Hitler's actions and the fact that he is not typically associated with noble or heroic warrior qualities.

Option (B) states, "Just like Hitler. A True demagogue." A "demagogue" is someone who appeals to the emotions of the people, especially for their own personal gain, often using manipulation and propaganda. This comparison to Hitler, who was a skilled demagogue, is also likely meant to be sarcastic, as it highlights his manipulative nature.

Both options seem to be sarcastic, but (A) "Just like Hitler. A True warrior" might be more overtly sarcastic due to the contrast between the revered title of "warrior" and the贬atory context of Hitler's legacy.

Therefore, the most sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In (A), the speaker suggests that if someone doesn't want high-risk investments, they should invest in Bitcoin, which is known for its volatile nature and high risk. This statement is sarcastic because it is suggesting the opposite of what the person would logically prefer, assuming they are risk-averse.

In (B), the speaker suggests that if someone doesn't want low-risk investments, they should also invest in Bitcoin, which again goes against the typical preference for low-risk options. However, this statement is less clear-cut in its sarcasm, as it could also be interpreted as a genuine suggestion, especially if Bitcoin was perceived as having potential low-risk benefits at the time.

Given the context, (A) is more overtly sarcastic because it directly contradicts the assumption of risk aversion.

So the answer is (A).

When discussing vaccines, both science and evolution play significant roles. Vaccines are developed based on scientific principles and discoveries, while their effectiveness is grounded in the theory of evolution, as they are designed to stimulate immunity by mimicking or containing weakened or dead pathogens.

Option (A) "SCIENCE CAUSES VACCINES!" could be interpreted as a straightforward statement acknowledging the role of science in vaccine creation. However, the use of all capital letters might suggest emphasis or sarcasm, making it seem like the speaker is emphasizing how obvious it is, possibly implying that the listener should already know this fact.

Option (B) "EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!" also correctly identifies evolution as a key driver of vaccines, as it explains why vaccines work by triggering the immune system's response to a specific pathogen.

In both cases, the statements are accurate, but if sarcasm is intended, (A) might be more likely because it uses a more exaggerated tone, which could be seen as mocking the listener for not understanding the obvious connection between science and vaccines.

Given the context, it's possible that (A) could be sarcastic, but without more context or cues, it's not entirely clear. If sarcasm is expected, (A) would be the better choice. So, the answer could be (A), but without additional context, it's speculative.

In the context of a healthy democracy, a civil war with a large death toll would obviously be a negative event. Therefore, if a statement suggests that such a situation is essential for a healthy democracy, it is not a realistic or positive view. Option (A) directly contradicts the idea of a healthy democracy and implies that suffering is necessary, which is highly unlikely to be intended sincerely.

On the other hand, Option (B) acknowledges the negative impact of a civil war with 500,000 deaths on a democracy, which aligns with common understanding.

Based on the logic, (A) is the sarcastic statement because it presents an absurd and unrealistic position that is meant to mock or criticize the notion that a civil war is good for a democracy.

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something with the intention of conveying the opposite meaning or mocking a statement. 

In (A), the statement "How pragmatic" implies that the dictator's assumption that people wouldn't get mad at him is a wise and practical decision, which is the opposite of the typical view of a violent and oppressive dictator. It is sarcastic because the speaker is actually criticizing the dictator's lack of foresight.

In (B), the statement "How naive" implies that the dictator's assumption is foolish, which aligns with the common perception of a dictator who doesn't consider the consequences of their actions. Here, the speaker is also expressing disbelief and criticism, but it is not as directly sarcastic as (A), as "naive" is a more straightforward term to describe the dictator's thought process.

Comparing both options, (A) is more sarcastic because it uses a word (pragmatic) that is the opposite of what we would expect for a violent oppressive dictator, while (B) is more straightforward in its criticism.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, usually to mock or criticize. 

In the case of (A), the statement "We all know diamonds are valuable" is a straightforward assertion of a commonly accepted fact, so it is not sarcastic.

In contrast, (B) says "We all know diamonds are worthless," which directly contradicts the widely acknowledged value of diamonds as precious gems. By stating the opposite of what is generally known, this sentence has a clear sarcastic tone, as if to imply that the speaker finds diamonds to be of no real worth.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B).

In the given options:
(A) "Psshh, everyone knows women can't earn profit" implies that women are incapable of earning profit, which is a stereotype and contradicts the reality that women can and do earn profits. This statement, by using sarcasm, is likely criticizing the notion that women are inherently less capable in this regard.

(B) "Psshh, everyone knows women can earn profit" directly asserts that women can indeed earn profit, which is not inherently sarcastic, as it aligns with the truth.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that is intended to be understood as the opposite of what is being said, often to mock or express disbelief.

In (A), the statement "Everyone knows that ignorance of the law excuses nobody from following the law" suggests that no matter how unaware one may be of the rules, they are still expected to abide by them. This is a straightforward and commonly accepted principle.

On the other hand, (B) says "Everyone knows ignorance of the law excuses you from following the law," which directly contradicts the first statement, implying that not knowing the law would be a valid reason for not obeying it. This is an unlikely and unrealistic claim, which implies sarcasm.

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something that is intended to be ironic or mocking, often with a tone that contradicts the literal meaning.

In (A), the phrase "not to see your fwb (friends with benefits) as a person" implies that treating someone as an object or a means to an end is a way to maintain independence. This is a cynical view, suggesting that seeing a person as a mere tool is a "trick" to remain independent, which could be sarcastic.

In (B), the phrase "not to see your fwb as a liability" suggests that treating a friend with benefits as a potential burden is what needs to be avoided for independence. This statement does not imply a negative view or irony; rather, it seems to be giving advice on how to maintain a healthy relationship dynamic.

Based on the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a negative perspective on the relationship dynamics in a seemingly straightforward manner, making it ironic or mocking the idea of independence through such a manipulation.

So the answer is (A).

Both options (A) and (B) express disbelief or disapproval regarding people's perceived right to protest or riot against a major corporation. However, the key difference between the two is the word "riot," which implies a more extreme and violent action compared to "protest."

In a sarcastic context, the use of "audacity" in (B) might be intended to mock the idea that anyone would dare to engage in a riot, as if such actions are particularly bold or unreasonable.

This kind of statement goes against the principle of universal human rights and is likely to be intended as a criticism or exaggeration, making it sarcastic.

Option (B) simply states that "not only first-world citizens deserve freedom," which could be interpreted as acknowledging that other people also deserve freedom, which is a more inclusive and reasonable statement.

(A) States that whistleblowers are great and in the public interest, and then asks for support when one of them accuses someone, implying that their actions should be encouraged. This is a mixed sentiment, but it doesn't seem overtly sarcastic.

(B) Also initially praises whistleblowers as heroes, but then suggests locking them up when they accuse someone, which is a stark contrast to the previous praise and implies the opposite of what the speaker claims to believe.

In (B), the phrase "because his word is clearly worth so much" directly contradicts the fact that he lied, suggesting that his word is highly valued, which would not be sarcastic; instead, it would be supportive of their decision to seek his testimony.

The question asks for a sarcastic statement. In both options, the speaker is contrasting Netflix with Comcast's On Demand service. 

Option (A) suggests that paying more for Comcast's On Demand would be a better choice than using Netflix, even though it implies the opposite – that Netflix is a better value despite the additional cost. This is a sarcastic statement because it is not a straightforward recommendation, but rather a humorous way of pointing out the higher price of the alternative.

Option (B) directly states that using Netflix is a better choice, as it implies that paying more to Comcast for On Demand is counterproductive. This statement is not sarcastic because it doesn't have the element of irony or humor typical of sarcasm.

When considering sarcasm, the statement should convey the opposite meaning of what is being said while appearing to be serious. 

In (A), the speaker is questioning the idea that something isn't an addiction just because it's legal, suggesting that legality doesn't absolve it from being addictive, which is a common point of view.

In (B), the speaker is questioning whether something being legal means it's not suspicious, which is a logical point since legality does not guarantee absence of suspicion. However, the phrase "right?" implies that the speaker actually believes the opposite – that legality does imply lack of suspicion – which is a form of sarcasm.

Based on the analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is (B). So the answer is (B).

(A) The statement implies that a small, independent company would naturally have terrible support, which is a common stereotype or exaggeration. It is likely meant to be ironic, as larger companies usually have more resources and should have better support.

(B) On the other hand, (B) suggests that a large conglomerate has terrible support because it's a small indie company, which is illogical and contradicts the typical perception of a big corporation. This statement doesn't fit the pattern of sarcasm, as it presents an absurd scenario.

Based on the analysis, (A) is the more sarcastic statement. So the answer is (A).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, often to mock or criticize.

In this case, if we consider the statement (A) "Yeah war is tragic," it acknowledges the negative aspect of war, which is tragedy. This aligns with the reality of war being a devastating event, so it's not sarcastic.

On the other hand, statement (B) "Yeah war is pacifying" directly contradicts the common understanding of war, as wars are typically not associated with peace or pacification. By saying war is pacifying, the speaker is suggesting that war has a calming effect, which is an unusual and unlikely claim, especially given the destructive nature of war. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

The statement (A) suggests that the assumption of being male on the internet until proven otherwise is considered sexist, implying that it is a negative aspect. Since sexism is generally viewed as a problem, describing it as "super sexist" would be a sarcastic way of expressing disagreement or pointing out the unfairness.

On the other hand, statement (B) describes the same situation as "super fun," which implies enjoyment or positivity. Given the context, assuming that the internet's default gender setting is sexist, calling it "fun" would likely be intended as a form of irony or sarcasm, as it is not typically seen as a positive experience.

Based on the analysis, both (A) and (B) could be interpreted as sarcastic, but (A) is more directly sarcastic as it criticizes the issue. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Isn't it super sexist that on the internet everyone is male until proven otherwise?

Both options present a similar structure where the speaker questions the validity of seeking validation from "the multitude" on the internet. However, the term "sociopaths" in option (A) implies a negative connotation, suggesting that the speaker believes the internet users are not reliable sources of validation and possibly even malicious. This choice is more likely to be sarcastic, as it presents a harsher and exaggerated view of internet users.

In contrast, option (B) simply refers to "users" without any specific negative descriptor, making it less overtly sarcastic.

So, the sarcastic statement is (A).

(A) The phrase "obviously monolithic services are the best solution for everyone" is sarcastic because it uses the word "obviously," implying that it is self-evident, when in reality, monolithic services (large, tightly integrated systems) are often criticized for their complexity and difficulties in scaling. By contrasting it with "webscale," which implies large-scale operations, the statement is making a point that monolithic services are not typically considered the best choice for web-scale situations.

(B) On the other hand, "Obviously microservices are the best solution for everyone" might initially sound like sarcasm because it is also using the word "obviously," but without any clear counterpoint or irony, it could just be a straightforward statement if the speaker genuinely believes microservices (small, modular services) are universally suitable. If there were no other context, it might not be clear whether the statement is sarcastic or not.

Given the context provided, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic as it directly contrasts a commonly criticized approach with the claim that it's the best solution for all. Therefore, the answer is (A).

The logic behind the statement about prices going up or down when people move out would typically be the opposite of what is stated. If people are leaving an area, it usually means less demand for housing, which would lead to lower prices, not higher ones. Therefore, if a statement suggests the opposite, it could be sarcastic.

In (A), it says prices keep going up when everybody is moving out, which is the opposite of the expected outcome. This is a likely candidate for sarcasm.

In (B), it says prices keep going down when everybody is moving out, which aligns with the expected outcome based on the logic of supply and demand. This statement doesn't seem sarcastic.

Based on this reasoning, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Option (A) suggests that an increase in dollars directly leads to more people becoming rich, which is not necessarily true. While more money might create more opportunities, wealth distribution is influenced by many factors beyond just the quantity of currency. The statement implies a naivety or oversimplification, which could indicate sarcasm.

Option (B) suggests that more dollars would lead to more people getting loans, which is a reasonable assumption as more money in circulation could potentially stimulate lending activity. There's no inherent irony or sarcasm in this statement.

Given the analysis, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) States that when small businesses struggle, the government would help by increasing its spending, which is generally seen as a supportive measure for businesses. This does not sound sarcastic, as it presents a positive response to the hypothetical situation.

(B) States that when small businesses struggle, the government would help by increasing taxes, which is the opposite of a supportive measure, as higher taxes can burden businesses further. This is a counterintuitive response, suggesting that the government might actually harm struggling businesses, which could be interpreted as sarcastic.

Given the logic, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Option (A) presents a statement that directly argues in favor of denying someone a loving family based on their skin color, which is clearly an unjust and unreasonable position. It doesn't seem sarcastic because it directly advocates for a morally reprehensible action.

On the other hand, Option (B) presents the opposite stance, describing the same action as "totally ridiculous," which implies that the idea of denying someone a loving family due to their skin color is absurd and unjustifiable. This statement uses irony to express the opposite sentiment of what is being said, which aligns with the definition of sarcasm.

The American Dream typically refers to the idea that anyone, regardless of their background, can achieve success through hard work and determination. However, Walmart is often associated with low-paying jobs and not being a stepping stone for upward mobility in many people's minds. 

Option (A) implies that despite working at Walmart, one can still achieve the American Dream, which might be seen as a tongue-in-cheek comment, suggesting that the path to the American Dream might be challenging or unlikely if one starts at Walmart.

Option (B) suggests that working at Walmart is directly tied to achieving the American Dream, which is not a typical perception and would not be sarcastic.

Based on the context, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic. So the answer is (A).

When comparing the two options:

(A) "So impressive winning cups in a league with 2 teams" - If a team wins cups in a league with only two teams, it implies that the competition is not very challenging, and winning might be expected due to the smaller number of competitors. This statement could be seen as sarcastic if the speaker is suggesting that winning isn't actually impressive in such a scenario.

(B) "So impressive winning cups in a league with 60 teams" - In contrast, if the team wins in a league with 60 teams, it would generally be considered more impressive because the competition is more intense.

Given that the sarcastic tone usually arises when something is said to be impressive when it might not logically be, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something with the intention to convey the opposite meaning. In the context of supporting a dictator, who is generally associated with negative attributes like oppression, cruelty, and authoritarianism, (A) is the more sarcastic option. It implies that supporting such a figure would be unattractive, which directly contradicts the actual appeal of supporting a dictator, which is often not seen as attractive.

On the other hand, (B) seems to be asking a question that appears to be seeking an absurdity, but without the context of sarcasm, it could be interpreted as genuinely questioning what might go wrong with supporting a dictator. However, when considering sarcasm, (B) is less clear.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

(A) The statement suggests that keeping your foot in one place while driving is helpful, which is a straightforward advice for maintaining control. It doesn't imply any irony or sarcasm.

(B) This statement, on the other hand, describes the difficulty of keeping your foot in one place while driving, which is a common observation, as drivers need to shift their foot between the brake and accelerator pedals. However, the phrase "very difficult" could be read as a sarcastic understatement, as it implies that it's easier said than done or that people often struggle with this.

Based on the analysis, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the implied irony.

So the answer is (B).

If we analyze both options:

(A) "conspiracy theory, sounds suspicious" - The phrase "sounds suspicious" implies doubt and disbelief, which is typically associated with sarcasm when discussing a conspiracy theory, as they are often seen as implausible or exaggerated.

(B) "conspiracy theory, sounds legit" - Here, "sounds legit" suggests that the speaker believes the conspiracy theory to be credible, which is not the typical response to a conspiracy theory, especially if one is being sarcastic.

Based on the context, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it questions the credibility of a conspiracy theory in a mocking manner.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

If the statement is sarcastic, it would mean that the speaker is actually expressing the opposite of what they say. In this case, if they say their friend is "very pleased" to be associated with something considered "trash," it would imply that they are actually mocking or expressing disdain.

In (A), the speaker is using sarcasm because they are questioning the "absurd claim" of history repeating itself if people ignore it. By describing it as absurd, the speaker is actually suggesting that the idea is not credible, which is the opposite of what a "thoughtful" or "insightful" claim would be.

On the other hand, in (B), the speaker is praising the claim as "insightful," which implies that they find it to be a well-considered observation. This directly contradicts the sarcastic tone of (A), where the claim is being dismissed as absurd.

Therefore, the statement that is sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).

Option (A) suggests that something is impossible in reality, specifically referring to software never malfunctioning. This directly contradicts the common understanding that software malfunctions do occur, making it an unlikely statement, which could be sarcastic if the speaker is pointing out how unrealistic it is to assume software would never fail.

Option (B), on the other hand, acknowledges the reality that software often malfunctions, which is a more realistic statement, as software errors are a common occurrence.

Based on this analysis, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an exaggeratedly unlikely scenario.

(B) States that the injuries and lack of consistent offensive line play had nothing to do with the issue. This directly contradicts common sense, as it is highly unlikely that such factors would not impact the performance.

In a sarcastic statement, the speaker would be expressing the opposite of what they believe or are saying. Given this, (B) is the sarcastic option because it is denying a fact that most people would consider to be true.

Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a seemingly sincere tone. In the context of this question, if the statement suggests that something done in a private setting couldn't possibly be held against you in a professional matter, it would be counterintuitive and unlikely to be true.

Option (A) implies that it is quite possible for something done in a private setting to come back and affect your professional life, which directly contradicts the expected sentiment.

Option (B), on the other hand, states that it is not like something in a private setting could ever be held against you, which implies that there is no risk, which is a more plausible and less sarcastic statement.

Based on the analysis, Option (A) is the sarcastic one.

The key to identifying sarcasm in this context is to consider the context and the typical expectations. If someone didn't get a reply in 2 years, it is generally unusual for someone to expect a prompt response, especially when compared to 2 minutes.

In (A), the statement implies that a long delay in receiving a reply would naturally lead to an understandable reaction, which is sarcastic because a delay of 2 years is far from being a reasonable expectation for a quick response.

In (B), on the other hand, a delay of 2 minutes is a much shorter time frame where a reply might be expected, so saying that his reaction is understandable in this context is not sarcastic.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
 75%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▌                     | 133/178 [1:46:14<38:03, 50.74s/it]================================================================================================================================
Both options (A) and (B) present the same statement, with the only difference being the addition of "you don't think" before the statement in (B). Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a mocking or exaggerated manner.

In both cases, the statement questions the feasibility of a hypothetical scenario involving ancient boats, Pacific Ocean crossing, and invading the Inland Northwest with Soviet-era MIGs. It's highly unlikely and seems absurd, which implies sarcasm.

However, the addition of "you don't think" in (B) could potentially indicate that the speaker expects the listener to believe the scenario is possible, which would suggest sarcasm. Without additional context, it's hard to determine if the speaker is being sarcastic or genuinely expressing disbelief.

Given the absurdity of the scenario, we can assume that the sarcasm is more likely in both cases. But if we choose the most explicit option for sarcasm, where the speaker is directly addressing the listener's expectations, (A) might be the more sarcastic choice since it omits the leading phrase, making it sound like a direct challenge.

So, the most sarcastic option would be (A).

The key to identifying sarcasm in these options is the context of the phrases. In both cases, the speaker is discussing a quality (self-centeredness or generosity) that involves putting one's own desires first, without regard for others' feelings.

In (A), the description of self-centeredness directly questions why someone should care about others' feelings when they are focused on their own gain. This statement is sarcastic because it uses a positive term ('self-centeredness') to describe an undesirable behavior.

In (B), the same phrase is used to describe generosity, which typically implies concern for others. By describing such a caring attitude with the same question about caring about others' feelings, the statement becomes paradoxical and ironic, suggesting that the speaker views generosity in a negative light.

So, the sarcastic statement is (A) since it is questioning the supposed goodness of self-centeredness, which is typically considered a negative trait.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

If we consider the context of stifling free speech and political opinions, (A) implies that the speaker is familiar with such occurrences, suggesting that they believe it's not an unusual situation, which could be sarcastic if the speaker is actually referring to a negative or oppressive situation.

On the other hand, (B) states that the speaker has never seen such a thing, which is the opposite of what (A) implies, and would seem to express genuine surprise or disbelief.

Based on the comparison, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it uses a form of irony to imply that the speaker is well-aware of the issue being discussed.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the nature of history, it is often complex and nuanced, with multiple perspectives and interpretations. Therefore, a statement suggesting that history is "usually" black and white would likely be considered oversimplistic or dismissive of the complexity.

Option (A) acknowledges the rarity of history being black and white, which implies that it's not a common occurrence, and could be seen as a sarcastic remark if it's meant to highlight how simplistic the idea of history being straightforward is.

On the other hand, Option (B) directly contradicts the typical understanding of history's complexity by stating it's usually black and white, which would not be sarcastic.

Based on this reasoning, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Both (A) and (B) present a similar scenario where the speaker claims to be a serious fan who prefers a quiet environment for better concentration during the performance. The use of "dead silent" and "extra good attention" implies that the speaker wants a perfect atmosphere for their enjoyment, which is a typical expectation from a serious fan.

However, the context of "symphony" and "hockey" is different, with symphony concerts generally being more formal and expected to have a quiet audience, while hockey games can be loud and energetic. The sarcasm would come from the contrast between the speaker's claim of being a serious fan and the implied desire for a situation that is at odds with the typical experience of each event.

Since (A) specifically mentions "serious symphony fan," it's more likely that the speaker is using sarcasm because they are making light of the idea that someone would want complete silence during a symphony, which is not a typical expectation.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

If we consider the context of being a lawmaker, it's generally expected that dedication and attendance are important qualities, but being a great lawmaker involves much more than just showing up every day. Statement (A) implies that attending work regularly is the sole determinant of being a great lawmaker, which is an over-simplification.

Statement (B) adds the word "alone," suggesting that merely showing up every day is not enough, there must be additional factors, making it sound like a critique or a sarcastic remark.

Given that sarcasm often involves an exaggerated or unexpected twist on a statement, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic as it implies that simply being present isn't enough to be great, while also highlighting the obviousness of the claim.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Option (A) suggests that the speaker finds it unlikely to trust a brief, unverified post from an anonymous internet user over a more credible source, which is a logical position to take. It implies that the speaker is being sarcastic when thanking the stranger, as they are actually expressing skepticism.

On the other hand, Option (B) directly contradicts the typical skepticism associated with trusting online strangers, by saying the speaker will trust their three-word post without sources. This would be an unusual and illogical choice, so if it were sincere, it would not be sarcastic.

If we consider the statement to be sarcastic, it should convey a meaning opposite to what is directly said.

In (A), the statement "Impossible!! There are no girls on the internet!" implies that the speaker finds it highly unlikely that there would be no girls online, especially given the vastness of the internet and its inclusivity. This statement, when meant sarcastically, could suggest that the speaker believes the idea of no girls being on the internet is absurd.

On the other hand, (B) "Impossible!! There are many girls on the internet!" directly contradicts the common stereotype that the internet is male-dominated, suggesting that it's obvious there are many girls online. If the speaker is being sarcastic, they might be pointing out how ridiculous it is to assume that there would be no girls on the internet.

Based on this analysis, both statements can potentially be sarcastic, but (A) leans more towards sarcasm as it challenges a commonly held belief with an exaggerated claim, while (B) can be seen as sarcastic if the speaker is indeed mocking the stereotype.

Given that sarcasm often involves irony and contradiction, the most likely sarcastic statement would be (A). So the answer is (A).

When considering sarcasm, we need to look for statements that imply the opposite of what is being said directly. In this case, the phrase "fresh-faced" typically refers to someone appearing youthful or innocent, especially when used to describe someone who is young.

(A) "You forget, he was just a fresh-faced 40 year old" - This statement is sarcastic because it is unusual to describe a 40-year-old as "fresh-faced," as that implies youthfulness, which is not typical for someone in their forties.

(B) "You forget, he was just a fresh-faced 18 year old" - This statement is more straightforward and does not imply the opposite of what is said. It describes a 18-year-old as having a youthful appearance, which is consistent with the term "fresh-faced."

Based on this analysis, statement (A) is sarcastic.

In the context of sarcasm, (A) "If it's on Britannica it must be True" can be seen as sarcastic because Britannica is generally considered a reliable source of information, but saying something must be true just because it's on there implies that the credibility of Britannica is overblown or taken for granted. The statement is meant to express skepticism or disbelief that something is automatically true based on its appearance in a respected source.

On the other hand, (B) "If it's on Reddit it must be True" is more likely to be perceived as a straightforward statement, as Reddit is a diverse platform where information can vary greatly in accuracy. While some content might be trustworthy, others might not, so the assumption that everything on Reddit is true is less likely to be intended sarcastically.

Based on these considerations, (A) is the more sarcastic statement. So the answer is (A).

The phrase "a series of tubes" is a reference to then-US Senator Al Franken's humorous description of the internet during a hearing on Net Neutrality in 2006. He was attempting to simplify the complex nature of the internet for a lay audience, but his wording was intentionally exaggerated for comedic effect, making it a form of satire or sarcasm.

Option (A) is a straightforward explanation of how the internet works, without any irony or exaggeration.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

Option (A) says, "Oh no the cleats with the new spikes didn't solve the problem?" This statement implies that the speaker expected the new spikes on the cleats to solve the problem but is expressing surprise or disappointment that they didn't. The sarcastic tone comes from the fact that it sounds like a rhetorical question, suggesting that the speaker already knows the answer, which is likely that the spikes were not the magical solution they hoped for.

Option (B) says, "Oh no the cleats with the new spikes didn't solve every problem?" This statement is more straightforward and acknowledges that the new spikes might not have solved all issues related to the cleats. It does not necessarily carry the same level of sarcasm as (A), as it doesn't imply that the speaker thinks the spikes were a complete failure.

Given the options, (A) is more sarcastic because it implies a higher degree of expectation followed by disappointment, while (B) is more neutral or realistic. So the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that conveys the opposite meaning of what is actually meant, often with a tone indicating humor or mockery.

In the case of (A), the statement "Soggy fries covered in bacon grease sounds unhealthy" directly reflects the potential negative health implications of such a food item. There isn't a clear indication of sarcasm here.

On the other hand, (B) says "Soggy fries covered in bacon grease sounds delicious," which contradicts the typical perception that soggy fries with greasy toppings would not be appetizing. This statement could be sarcastic because it implies that someone finds an unappealing combination appealing, which is a common form of sarcasm.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B). The answer is (B).

Option (A) suggests that the real tragedy is not the act of purchasing something fraudulent, which is unexpected given that a fraud would typically be considered a negative situation. Instead, it implies that the more significant issue is someone being fooled into the purchase, which might suggest that they are unaware of the deception. This statement has a tone of sarcasm, as the actual tragedy (in the speaker's view) is the lack of discernment rather than the act itself.

On the other hand, Option (B) is a straightforward statement expressing that the real tragedy is that someone is buying a Mustang, which could be a genuine concern if the buyer cannot afford it or if it's otherwise a poor decision for them.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) Suggests that the speaker assumes the listener is inexperienced or forgetful enough to need a reminder for something as basic as printing a legal-sized piece of paper, which is a common task that most people should know how to do. This implies sarcasm because it treats a simple action as if it were a significant challenge.

(B) Requests a reminder for printing a blank piece of paper, which is also a straightforward task, but it doesn't necessarily imply any lack of knowledge or sarcasm as it could genuinely be a question from someone who has forgotten or needs a refresher.

Based on the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because of the implied criticism of the listener's abilities.

So the answer is (A).

Sarcasm usually involves saying something that is meant to be taken as the opposite of what is being said, often with a tone indicating disbelief or humor at the expense of the statement's credibility.

In the given options:
(A) But only 10000 economists said it will help the economy.
(B) But only 2 economists said it will help the economy.

Both statements express a contrast, with the second one having a smaller number (2) compared to the first (10,000). If the statement is meant to be sarcastic, it would imply that a larger number of experts would generally carry more weight, so a low number like 2 would be seen as unlikely to support the claim.

Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses the word "only" to emphasize how insignificant the number of economists supporting the claim is, suggesting that the speaker may find it unbelievable or is making fun of the argument.

So the answer is (B).
 84%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▏             | 149/178 [1:58:21<24:03, 49.79s/it]================================================================================================================================
(A) "How dare you use violence!!!" - This statement is sarcastic because using violence is generally considered to be a negative action, and the exclamation points and the phrase "how dare you" imply that the speaker is surprised and disapproving, even though they are encouraging the use of violence.

(B) "How dare you use logic!!!” - This statement is also sarcastic, but for a different reason. Using logic is generally seen as a positive and rational approach, so if someone were to express surprise or disapproval at its usage, it would imply that the listener is expected to be irrational or illogical, which is an unusual criticism.

In both cases, the sarcastic tone comes from the unexpectedness of the criticism given the nature of the actions being criticized.

So, both options (A) and (B) are sarcastic, but (B) might be slightly more subtle due to the double irony of criticizing the use of something (logic) that is usually valued. If we must choose only one, (A) might be slightly more straightforward in its sarcasm.
 84%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▋             | 150/178 [1:59:16<23:51, 51.11s/it]================================================================================================================================
Sarcasm involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning, often in a mocking or critical tone. 

In this case, if the statement is meant to be sarcastic, it should express a negative opinion about putting people in neat little compartments, even though the phrase "good idea" is being used.

Option (A) says "Stop putting people in neat little compartments to protect your viewpoint — good idea." Here, the speaker is suggesting that stopping the practice is a good idea, which is the opposite of what would be expected if they were advocating for maintaining these compartments.

Option (B) says "Keep putting people in neat little compartments to protect your viewpoint — good idea." In this case, the speaker is directly supporting the action, which aligns with the expected sentiment if the statement were not sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

The term "sarcastic" implies that the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean in a mocking or mockingly serious manner. In both options, the adjective "baseless" suggests that the accusation being made has no foundation.

In (A), "wonderful" is an unexpected choice of word when describing a baseless accusation, as "wonderful" generally carries a positive connotation, whereas a baseless accusation is typically considered negative. By using sarcasm, the speaker might be expressing their disbelief or disdain for the claim.

In (B), "striking" also implies something impressive or noticeable, which would be unusual to describe a baseless accusation. Like "wonderful," it is an unexpected choice that could indicate sarcasm.

Given the context, both (A) and (B) can be interpreted as sarcastic due to the incongruity between the positive adjectives and the negative subject matter.

Therefore, the answer is either (A) or (B). Both options can be considered sarcastic, depending on the tone and context in which they are used.

Option (A) suggests that not engaging in manual labor like spinning clothes, mining, and forging is beneficial, implying that modern society has progressed positively because of the division of labor and specialized production.

Option (B), on the other hand, suggests that not doing these tasks ourselves is detrimental, implying that these activities are essential for personal well-being and that modern society is worse off for not relying on them.

Given the context of sarcasm, which usually involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a humorous or critical way, (B) is the more sarcastic statement because it presents the opposite view of the benefits of specialization, which is typically seen as a positive aspect of modern life.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite, often to mock or ridicule. In this case:

(A) States that one failed test from six years ago is insufficient proof for recent cheating, which implies that it's not a strong basis for accusing someone. This could be seen as a sarcastic statement if the speaker believes that there should be stronger evidence to support the claim.

(B) States that the same failed test from six years ago is devastating proof, suggesting that it's a strong and conclusive evidence. This is the opposite of what sarcasm would imply, as it would typically not be considered devastating proof after such a long time.

Given the definitions, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it downplays the significance of the evidence and might be meant to express disbelief or skepticism.

So the answer is (A).
 87%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▌           | 154/178 [2:02:47<21:30, 53.78s/it]================================================================================================================================
The statement (A) says "Remember, his Batman score isn't the only Batman theme," which implies that there are other Batman themes besides the one being referred to. This seems like a straightforward observation, not necessarily sarcastic.

On the other hand, statement (B) says "Remember, his Batman score is the only Batman theme," which contradicts the common understanding that there are multiple Batman themes associated with the character. By stating that it's the only one, it implies a level of exclusivity that is unlikely to be true, which could be interpreted as a sarcastic way of pointing out the absurdity or exaggeration.

Given the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it goes against the typical understanding and seems to be highlighting the exaggeration of the claim.

So, the answer is (B).
 87%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████           | 155/178 [2:03:39<20:22, 53.13s/it]================================================================================================================================
Both options (A) and (B) express a situation where someone is close to achieving a goal (1000 points in this case), but the scale at which they're expressing difficulty might suggest sarcasm.

In (A), the statement "I'm just 800 points from 1k" implies that the person finds it effortless, as 800 points is a significant distance from the target. It's unusual to describe such a large gap as "easy," so this statement could be sarcastic.

In (B), the statement "I'm just 8 points from 1k" is closer to the goal, so it would be more reasonable to consider it easier than 800 points away. If the person genuinely finds it easy, this might not be sarcastic.

Given the context, it's more likely that (A) is sarcastic, as it presents a situation where reaching a smaller milestone would be considered more challenging than it seems.

Therefore, the answer is (A).
 88%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▍          | 156/178 [2:04:35<19:50, 54.12s/it]================================================================================================================================
When discussing sample sizes in statistics, a dozen people are indeed a very small number compared to the entire population of the United States. Therefore, suggesting that a dozen people can represent 320 million people is illogical and absurd.

Option (A) directly states that a small sample size is representative, which is not the typical stance one would take when discussing the inadequacy of a small sample. It's more likely to be sarcastic.

Option (B), on the other hand, acknowledges the obvious fact that a dozen people is not a sufficient sample size, making it a straightforward statement without the overt sarcasm present in (A).

Based on this reasoning, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The statement (A) says, "Better not buy any technology ever because in a few years something better will be released!!" It implies that constantly waiting for better technology is unwise and suggests that one should never invest in current technology due to the anticipation of future improvements. This statement has a tone of exaggeration and dissatisfaction, which could be seen as sarcastic.

On the other hand, statement (B) adds the word "exorbitant," which narrows down the suggestion and implies that one should avoid buying expensive technology, not all technology. While it still suggests that future releases might be superior, it does not convey the same level of absurdity or dissatisfaction as (A).

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to its exaggerated and dismissive nature. Therefore, the answer is (A).

The term "bigot" typically carries a negative connotation, referring to someone who displays prejudice or intolerance towards others based on their race, beliefs, etc. If someone is showing up and getting nosy, it implies they are being intrusive or bothersome, which might be an undesirable situation.

In (A), the speaker expresses enjoyment when bigots are present and engaging in nosy behavior, which is likely not a genuine sentiment but rather a mocking or sarcastic comment because it's expected that one would not "love" bigots or their behavior.

On the other hand, (B) mentions "getting roasted," which usually means someone is being publicly criticized or mocked in a humorous or aggressive way. In this context, it could be seen as a more direct expression of dislike for the bigot's presence, but it's not necessarily sarcastic. It's more straightforward in its negativity.

Based on the analysis, (A) is the more sarcastic statement, as it implies the opposite of what one would expect (enjoying bigots' intrusion) in a sarcastic manner.

So, the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning. 

In (A), the statement "Nice try, but everyone knows there are no women active on the internet" implies that the speaker believes women are not present online, which is a sweeping generalization and likely untrue. The phrase "nice try" is often used sarcastically when someone is being facetious or mocking a claim.

On the other hand, (B) "Nice try, but everyone knows there are many women active on the internet" directly contradicts the common stereotype that women are not active online, which is a more accurate statement and does not have the same sarcastic tone.

Based on this analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement.

So the answer is (A).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite or is intended to mock or criticize, usually in a humorous way.

In (A), the statement says "I'm spoiled by my instant access to entertainment and information." The speaker is expressing gratitude or appreciation for the ease of access, which would not be sarcastic.

On the other hand, in (B), the statement says "I'm oppressed by my instant access to entertainment and information." Here, the speaker is suggesting that having easy access to these things is a burden or negative experience, which is the opposite of being grateful for it. This could be a sarcastic way of expressing frustration or exaggerating the inconvenience, especially if the context implies that the speaker actually enjoys this access.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

(A) Suggests that having massive watermarks on videos improves the viewer's experience, which is the opposite of what would be expected, as watermarks typically detract from the visual quality.

(B) States that having massive watermarks over videos worsens the experience, which aligns with common understanding, as watermarks are generally seen as a negative aspect for video viewing.

Option (A) suggests that filling the entire photo with a landscape would be visually appealing, which might be a genuine suggestion if the context were about photography. However, sarcasm often involves a double meaning or an implied contradiction.

Option (B) suggests that having someone's face fill the entire photo would look good, which is a direct contrast to the typical advice for portrait photography, where a balance between the subject and the background is preferred. By saying "That'd look good," the speaker is likely mocking the idea of an overly large face dominating the image, making it a sarcastic remark.

If we consider the context of sarcasm, the statement should convey a meaning that is the opposite of what is being said. 

In (A), the statement suggests concern for a poor man losing his job, which might be expected to be a serious issue for him. Sarcasm would imply that the situation is not actually a problem or even desirable, so this could be sarcastic if the speaker believes the poor man wouldn't miss the job.

In (B), the statement mentions a "poor man" and suggests concern about him losing his yacht, which is typically not a possession a poor person would have. In reality, it would be highly unlikely for a poor person to own a yacht. Therefore, suggesting that he'd struggle without it is not only implausible but also implies a lack of understanding of the person's actual circumstances, making it a likely candidate for sarcasm.

Given these analyses, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

Option (A) says that the film received the lowest gross sales for a recent action film, and then adds "Yeah, no one is rewatching," which implies that despite its low sales, it's not popular enough to warrant a second viewing. This is a sarcastic statement because the low sales are being presented as a reason for its lack of rewatchability, which is the opposite of what would be expected if the film were actually good.

On the other hand, Option (B) states that the film received the highest gross sales for a recent action film, and then adds "Yeah, no one is rewatching." This statement is contradictory, as high sales would typically imply popularity and more chances for rewatching. However, without additional context, it might not be as clear as (A) that the speaker is being sarcastic, as it could also be a genuine observation that despite the film's financial success, it lacks a lasting appeal.

Based on the analysis, (A) is the more sarcastic statement because it directly contradicts itself in a humorous way. So the answer is (A).

(A) "Yes, responsibility should be celebrated" - This statement seems to be in favor of a positive quality, which is responsibility, which is generally considered a good thing. There is no inherent sarcasm here.

(B) "Yes, negligence should be celebrated" - This statement is directly opposing the norm, as negligence is typically seen as a negative trait, and celebrating it would be unusual. This statement is more likely to be sarcastic, as it is suggesting that something undesirable should be valued.

Option (A) states, "Because Romania is not a real country, obviously." Romania is a well-known and recognized country, so this statement is making a claim that is factually incorrect, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic statements.

Option (B) states, "Because Atlantis is not a real country, obviously." Atlantis is a mythical place, not a real country, so this statement is also factually accurate and not inherently sarcastic.

In (A), the speaker is describing a typical action of using a computer, which involves bringing a keyboard and mouse to a computer and plugging them in. This statement is straightforward and practical, not indicating sarcasm.

However, in (B), the speaker suggests bringing a keyboard and mouse to a bus, which is unusual because buses don't usually have ports for plugging in peripherals like computers. It's implausible and goes against the common understanding of where one would use a keyboard and mouse. Therefore, the statement is likely sarcastic, as it implies the impracticality of attempting to use a computer setup on a bus.

So the sarcastic option is (B).

The statement (B) "Nobody can be successful without having inherited all their money first" is sarcastic. The use of "nobody" implies that it is impossible for anyone to achieve success without inheriting wealth, which is a clear exaggeration and contradicts common knowledge, as many successful people have achieved their accomplishments through hard work and determination, not solely through inheritance.

On the other hand, (A) "Anyone can be successful without having inherited all their money first" is a straightforward statement, suggesting that success is attainable without relying on inherited wealth, which aligns with the idea that hard work matters.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).

When evaluating the sarcasm in these statements, we consider the context and the implied tone. If Alabama beating a highly ranked team is expected to secure their position, then (A) might be sarcastic if the speaker is suggesting that beating only the #1 team should be a given for inclusion, and it shouldn't matter what ranking the opponent has.

On the other hand, (B) suggests that beating a lower-ranked team (#17) might be seen as sufficient for getting into something, implying that perhaps the expectations are lower.

Given that beating a higher-ranked team would typically carry more weight, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it implies that beating just the #1 team should be an easy accomplishment to merit entry.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the context of park rules, (A) is suggesting that someone is forbidden from walking in the park, even if it's their own property, which is unusual and illogical. This statement is likely to be sarcastic because it implies that the rule is absurd.

On the other hand, (B) states that smoking is not allowed in the park but only on one's own property, which is a more reasonable restriction when compared to walking, as smoking restrictions are common in public spaces for health reasons. This statement doesn't seem sarcastic based on the context.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Option (A) suggests that handouts being unfair when they go to businesses and not consumers is a reasonable position, which might be the expected sentiment.

Option (B) states that handouts are "fine" when they go to businesses and not consumers, which is an unexpected stance since typically, handouts are seen as more beneficial for individuals, not corporations.

Therefore, the sarcastic option would be (B) because it is presenting a viewpoint that goes against the usual understanding that handouts should be directed towards those in need, like consumers.

(A) "Good thing you can boil impurities out of water" is a sarcastic statement because it implies that boiling water is a fortunate solution to remove unwanted substances, even though it is a basic fact that boiling water does remove impurities. The sarcasm lies in the understatement, as if it were a trivial matter when dealing with impurities.

(B) "Good thing you can boil Uranium out of water" is not sarcastic in the same way. It is a direct statement, acknowledging the potential for removing a harmful substance (uranium) from water through boiling. While it might be true that it's not a desirable situation to have uranium in water, the statement is not making a joke about the process.

In both options, the speaker is discussing a potential memory strategy that involves associating negative emotions with something in order to remember it more vividly. In (A), the phrase "Weirdest memorization plan ever" suggests that the speaker finds this method unconventional or absurd, which aligns with the definition of sarcasm, as it implies the opposite of what is being said.

In (B), the phrase "Best memorization plan ever" suggests that the speaker believes this method is highly effective, which would be the opposite of the implied meaning in (A). Given the context of discussing a potentially negative mental health experience, it's unlikely that associating something bad with it would be considered the best memorization technique.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the context of the statement, "fat-shaming" refers to criticizing someone or something for being overweight, usually in a negative manner. Cats, being animals, cannot be fat-shamed as they do not have the same societal constructs or self-awareness as humans.

(A) suggests that people should not treat cats like they are human beings capable of feeling shame, which is a clear exaggeration and implies that the speaker believes the argument is ridiculous.

(B) suggests that cats are sensitive to being fat-shamed, which is an unusual claim, but not necessarily sarcastic. It could be taken as a light-hearted or joking remark if the speaker is making a point about how cats can feel when being unfairly criticized.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to its exaggerated nature and the implied absurdity.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Both options (A) and (B) present the same statement, suggesting that Honda will be at the top of the market due to new designs coming out ten times faster than their competitors. Since both statements are identical, there is no clear indication of sarcasm in either of them. They seem to express a straightforward prediction.

However, if we consider the possibility that sarcasm might be hidden in the context, we might interpret (A) as sarcastic if the intended meaning is that Honda's slow pace of new designs actually indicates they will fall behind rather than rise to the top. But without additional context, it's hard to definitively say that (A) is sarcastic.

Given the information provided, there is no clear sarcastic statement among the options. If sarcasm was expected, more context would be needed to determine which, if any, of the statements is meant to convey the opposite meaning.

Both (A) and (B) express the idea that making sweeping generalizations about women's intelligence will have a negative impact on how they perceive you. However, (A) suggests that such behavior would actually win you points, which is the opposite of what would logically be expected if the statement were sincere. On the other hand, (B) directly states that it would lose you points, which aligns with the typical understanding of treating people fairly and not stereotyping.

Given that sarcasm involves saying the opposite of what is meant, (A) is the sarcastic statement because it presents the opposite outcome of what a logical or respectful approach would be.

So the answer is (A).

Option (A) states, "We've not spoken since graduating high school 7 years ago, she's basically my bestie." The phrase "basically my bestie" contradicts the earlier claim of not speaking since graduation, suggesting that the speaker is being sarcastic about considering her a close friend despite the lack of communication.

Option (B) states, "We've consistently spoken since graduating high school 7 years ago, she's basically my bestie." This statement directly supports the idea that they have been in regular contact, which aligns with the claim of being best friends.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
