We have two tables: one for penguins and one for giraffes. The question asks how many animals in total are more than 5 years old.

For the penguins:
- Louis is 7 years old
- Bernard is 5 years old
- Vincent is 9 years old
- Gwen is 8 years old

So, there are 3 penguins (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen) that are more than 5 years old.

For the giraffes:
- Jody is 5 years old
- Gladys is 10 years old
- Marian is 2 years old
- Donna is 9 years old

There are 2 giraffes (Gladys and Donna) that are more than 5 years old.

Adding the penguins and giraffes that are more than 5 years old, we have:
3 penguins + 2 giraffes = 5 animals

The answer is (A) 5.

First, let's consider the penguins before adding James and deleting Bernard:

- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 11 kg)
- Gwen (8 years, 15 kg)

After adding James (12 years, 12 kg):

- James (12 years, 12 kg)
- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 11 kg)
- Gwen (8 years, 15 kg)

Now, let's remove Bernard (5 years, 13 kg):

- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 11 kg)
- Gwen (8 years, 15 kg)
- James (12 years, 12 kg)

There are three penguins left: Louis, Vincent, and James. Out of these, only Louis is less than 5 years old (7 years). Therefore, the penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg are Vincent and James.

So, there are 2 penguins that meet these criteria. The answer is (B).

To find the average height of all the penguins, we need to add up the heights of all penguins and then divide by the total number of penguins.

Here are the heights:
- Louis: 50 cm
- Bernard: 80 cm
- Vincent: 60 cm
- Gwen: 70 cm
- James: 90 cm

Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70 + 90
Total height = 350 cm

There are 5 penguins in total (including the newly added James).

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins
Average height = 350 cm / 5
Average height = 70 cm

So the correct answer is (C) 70.

To find the cumulated weight of all the penguins, we need to add up the weights from the original table and the new penguin, James.

Original weights:
- Louis: 11 kg
- Bernard: 13 kg
- Vincent: 11 kg
- Gwen: 15 kg

New penguin, James:
- Weight: 12 kg

Cumulative weight = (Louis's weight) + (Bernard's weight) + (Vincent's weight) + (Gwen's weight) + (James's weight)
Cumulative weight = 11 + 13 + 11 + 15 + 12

Let's calculate this sum:

The question asks about the number of species, but since the table only provides information about individual penguins with their names, ages, heights, and weights, it does not contain any information about species. Therefore, based on the given data, we cannot determine the number of species.

However, if we assume that all penguins mentioned are of the same species (which is common in such scenarios), then there would be only one species listed. But without explicit information about species, the correct answer would be (E) 5, as it includes all the individuals, even if they belong to the same species.

If you meant to ask for the number of distinct penguin types or species, the answer would be (A) 1, assuming they are all of the same species. If there were different species, the question would need more context to provide an accurate answer.

The question asks for the name of the penguin with a height of 0.6 meters. First, we need to convert the height given in centimeters (cm) to meters (m). Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, we divide the height in centimeters by 100.

Louis has a height of 50 cm, which is not 0.6 m.
Bernard has a height of 80 cm, which is not 0.6 m either (80 cm / 100 = 0.8 m).
Vincent has a height of 60 cm, which is 0.6 m when converted (60 cm / 100 = 0.6 m).

Gwen's height is 70 cm, which is also not 0.6 m (70 cm / 100 = 0.7 m).

None of the penguins listed have a height exactly equal to 0.6 m. However, Vincent comes closest with 0.6 m. Therefore, the answer should be (C) Vincent. Note that it's not an exact match, but since the question asks for the closest, Vincent is the best choice.

So, there are 4 penguins more than 5 years old.

For the giraffes, we have:
- Jody (5 years old)
- Gladys (10 years old)
- Marian (2 years old)
- Donna (9 years old)

So, there are 3 giraffes more than 5 years old.

Since the question asks for the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order, we only need to consider the penguins from the first table, as the second table is about giraffes and not relevant to this part of the question.

The penguins in alphabetical order are Bernard, Gwen, Louis, and Vincent. The last one in alphabetical order would be the one that comes after Vincent, which is Louis.

So the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Louis. The answer is (A).

First, let's consider the penguins before adding or deleting any:
- Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Vincent is 9 years old but we don't have his weight, but assuming it's less than 12 kg since no other penguin has a higher weight, he might count.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg, so she doesn't meet the weight criteria.

After adding James:
- James is 12 years old, so he doesn't fit the "less than 8 years old" criteria.

After deleting Bernard:
- Louis is still 7 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Vincent is now the only one younger than 8 years old, and we assume his weight is less than 12 kg.

So, there are 2 penguins (Louis and Vincent) less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg. The answer is (B).

We have the penguins' names sorted alphabetically: Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.

To find the next to last penguin, we look at the penultimate name in the sorted list. Since the list ends with Vincent, the name before Vincent would be the next to last one.

The name of the next to last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Louis. So the answer is (A).

First, we have 4 penguins in the table initially: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. After adding James, there are 5 penguins.

Then, we delete Bernard, so we subtract 1 from the total count. 

So, the number of animals left in the table after deleting Bernard is 5 - 1 = 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4.

This question asks for the second youngest penguin. According to the ages provided:

- Louis is 7 years old
- Bernard is 5 years old
- Vincent is 9 years old
- Gwen is 8 years old

Since Bernard is 5 years old and Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is the youngest, and Louis is the next youngest. Therefore, Louis is the second youngest penguin.

The correct answer is (A) Louis.

This question asks about the number of species listed in the tables. There are two tables provided: one for penguins and one for giraffes. Each table lists individuals from a different species.

For the penguins:
- Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, and James are all penguins.

For the giraffes:
- Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna are giraffes.

So, there are two distinct species listed: penguins and giraffes.

The correct answer is (B) 2.

We have two tables:

1. Penguin table with 4 penguins (Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, and the added James).
2. Giraffe table with 4 giraffes (Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna).

Adding the penguins and giraffes together, there are a total of 4 (penguins) + 4 (giraffes) = 8 animals listed in the tables.

This question asks for penguins with two conditions: age less than 8 and weight less than 12 kg. From the table, we have:

- Louis: age 7, weight 11 kg
- Bernard: age 5, weight 13 kg

Louis meets both conditions, while Bernard only meets the age condition but not the weight condition. Therefore, there is 1 penguin that is less than 8 years old and weighs less than 12 kg.

The answer is (A) 1.

After deleting Bernard, we have three penguins:
- Louis: 7 years
- Vincent: 9 years
- Gwen: 8 years

To find the cumulated age, we add up the ages of these three penguins:
7 + 9 + 8 = 24 years

So, the cumulated age of the penguins after deleting Bernard is 24 years. The answer is (A).

First, we have four penguins before adding James and deleting Bernard:

- Louis: weight = 11 kg
- Vincent: weight = 11 kg
- Gwen: weight = 15 kg
- James: weight = 12 kg (not yet added)

After adding James but before deleting Bernard, the total weight would be:

Louis + Vincent + Gwen + James = 11 + 11 + 15 + 12

Now let's calculate the total weight:

49 kg

However, we need to subtract Bernard's weight since he's been deleted:

49 kg (total with James) - Bernard's weight = 49 kg - 13 kg

Let's do the subtraction:

49 - 13 = 36 kg

So the cumulated weight after adding James and deleting Bernard is 36 kg, which corresponds to option (B).

- Gwen (8 years, 70 kg)

After deleting Bernard, we have:
- Louis (7 years, 50 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 60 kg)

This question asks for the total age of all the penguins and giraffes. We can simply add up the ages from both tables:

For penguins:
- Louis: 7
- Bernard: 5
- Vincent: 9
- Gwen: 8
Total penguin age = 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 = 29

For giraffes:
- Jody: 5
- Gladys: 10
- Marian: 2
- Donna: 9
Total giraffe age = 5 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 26

Cumulated age of penguins and giraffes = 29 (penguins) + 26 (giraffes) = 55

So the correct answer is (D) 55.

To find the average height of the penguins, we need to add up the heights of all the penguins and then divide by the number of penguins.

Louis' height = 50 cm
Bernard's height = 80 cm
Vincent's height = 60 cm
Gwen's height = 70 cm

Total height = Louis + Bernard + Vincent + Gwen
Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70

Now, let's calculate the sum:

Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70 = 260 cm

There are 4 penguins in total.

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins
Average height = 260 cm / 4

Now, let's perform the division:

Average height = 65 cm

The average height of the penguins is 65 cm. So the correct answer is (B).

The given information does not specify the gender of any penguin. Therefore, based on the provided table, we cannot determine which penguin is female. The options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) represent names without gender information. Without additional data, the answer is unknown.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which penguin has the highest weight?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's look at the weight column for each penguin:
- Louis: 11 kg
- Bernard: 13 kg
- Vincent: 11 kg
- Gwen: 15 kg

Gwen has the highest weight among the listed penguins. So the correct answer is (D).

To find the penguin that is taller than the others, we need to compare the height values from the given information. 

Here are the heights:
- Louis: 50 cm
- Bernard: 80 cm
- Vincent: 60 cm
- Gwen: 70 cm

From this list, Bernard has the tallest height at 80 cm.

So the correct answer is (B) Bernard.

We already have the names of the penguins in the original table: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. When we add James, the list becomes:

1. Louis
2. Bernard
3. Vincent
4. Gwen
5. James

To find the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order, we simply look at the names in the order they appear: Bernard, Gwen, James, Louis, Vincent.

So, the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Vincent.

The answer is (C).
