Given these steps, the correct answer is:
(C) The orange book is the second from the left.

Since the truck is the oldest and the sedan is the newest, the bus must be between them in terms of age. Therefore, the bus is the second-oldest, which means the sedan is the second-newest.
The sedan is the second-newest. So the answer is (B).

(2) The blue jay is to the right of the quail: "(left) ? quail ? blue jay ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2), since the falcon comes after the blue jay, and the blue jay comes after the quail, the quail must be the leftmost, with the blue jay next, and the falcon on the right.
The quail is the leftmost. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options. However, based on the logic, the correct answer would be that the quail is the rightmost, but none of the given options reflect this.

From this ordering, the hawk is the leftmost since it's mentioned before the raven, and the crow is the rightmost.

Therefore, the hawk is the first from the left, and the crow is the rightmost. This means the raven must be the second from the left.

(1) Kiwis are less expensive than the loquats: "kiwis < loquats".
(2) Cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis: "cantaloupes < kiwis".
From these two statements, we can deduce that:
- If kiwis are cheaper than loquats, and loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes, then the cantaloupes must be the least expensive.
- Since kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes, they cannot be the most expensive.

Therefore, the cantaloupes are the most expensive. The answer is (C).

(2) Cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis: "(expensive) ? kiwis ? cantaloupes".
(3) Combining (1) and (2), we get: "(expensive) loquats kiwis cantaloupes".

From this, we can deduce that the kiwis are the least expensive, and since the cantaloupes come after them, the loquats must be the most expensive, followed by the kiwis, and then the cantaloupes.

Therefore, the loquats are the second-most expensive. The answer is (B).

(1) The black book is to the left of the purple book: "(left) ? black ? purple ? (right)".
(2) The purple book is to the left of the white book: "(left) purple ? white ? (right)".

Combining (1) and (2), we get a contradiction because if the black book is to the left of the purple book, and the purple book is to the left of the white book, then the white book cannot be to the left of the purple book. This means that the given information is logically inconsistent.

However, since the options do not reflect this inconsistency, we can choose the option that best fits the first statement, even though it doesn't match the second. Based on the first statement alone, the white book would be the leftmost if the purple book was not involved in the conflict.

(A) The white book is the leftmost.

Given the available options, we choose (A) as the answer, even though it does not match the second statement due to the inconsistency in the description.

According to this ordering, the peaches are the least expensive, so they cannot be the most expensive.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) The peaches are not the most expensive.

However, since we don't have another option that directly states the peaches are not the most expensive, we can infer that the statement that best fits the information given is that the pears are the most expensive, as they come after the cheaper mangoes and before the cheapest peaches.

So, the answer is (B) The pears are the most expensive.

(2) Cantaloupes are more expensive than watermelons: "(more expensive) ? cantaloupes ? watermelons".
From these two statements, we can deduce that:
"(expensive) ? oranges > (more expensive) ? cantaloupes > watermelons".

This implies that the order of price from most to least expensive is: oranges, cantaloupes, watermelons.

Therefore, the second-most expensive are the cantaloupes.
The answer is (A).
