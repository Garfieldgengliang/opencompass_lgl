Let's track the partners for each character after each switch:

- Alice starts with Melissa, then switches with Fred: Alice-Fred, Melissa unknown
- Gertrude and Eve switch: Gertrude-Eve, Eve unknown
- Gertrude and Alice switch: Gertrude-Alice, Eve-Fred
- Bob and Alice switch: Bob-Alice, Gertrude-Fred
- Dave and Fred switch: Dave-Fred, Bob unknown
- Eve and Alice switch: Eve-Alice, Dave-Bob
- Eve and Claire switch: Eve-Claire, Dave unknown

At the end of the dance, Gertrude is with the last person she danced with before the final Eve-Claire switch, which was Alice. So Gertrude is dancing with Alice.

However, since this is a multiple-choice question and we're looking for Gertrude's partner, the answer should be the last partner of Alice after all these swaps. Alice started with Melissa, then switched with Fred, so Gertrude ends up with:

(G) Melissa

Therefore, the answer is (G).
  1%|█                                                                                      | 3/250 [02:37<3:42:18, 54.00s/it]================================================================================================================================
We will go through the sequence of partner switches:

1. Dave and Claire switch: Dave: Sam, Claire: Dave
2. Alice and Eve switch: Alice: Eve, Eve: ?? (we don't know yet)
3. Eve and Bob switch: Eve: Bob, Bob: ?? (still unknown)
4. Claire and Bob switch: Claire: Bob, Bob: Eve
5. Fred and Eve switch: Fred: Eve, Eve: Fred
6. Gertrude and Dave switch: Gertrude: Dave, Dave: Fred
7. Dave and Alice switch: Dave: Alice, Alice: ?? (Alice's previous partner)

Now, we know that after all these switches, Dave ends up with Alice, since that's the last switch mentioned. Alice's previous partner before switching with Dave was Eve, so Eve must be with someone else now. We can fill in the blanks step by step:

- Eve starts with Bob, then becomes Eve (since she switches back), then with Fred, then with Dave.

So at the end, Eve is dancing with Dave's previous partner, which is Alice's previous partner, Fred.

The correct answer is (F) Rodrigo, because Eve was dancing with Fred before switching with Dave, and now Fred is left without a partner.

Therefore, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo.
