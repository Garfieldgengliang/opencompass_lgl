7pm-8pm: taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
8pm-9pm: not mentioned where Hannah was.
9pm-8pm: the beach was closed.

From the information given, we cannot determine the exact time Hannah went to the beach since there is no mention of her activities between 7am and 9am or after 7pm. However, since the beach was open until 8pm and she could have gone there before her other activities started, the earliest possible time she could have gone is 7am to 9am. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7am to 9am.

The only time when William could have gone to the bookstore is between the time he finished working out at the gym and the time he started working at the office, which is 8am to 5pm.

None of the given time periods between 8am to 10pm include going to the construction site. However, we can infer that Emily could have gone to the construction site between 11am (when she was no longer at the rooftop) and 1pm (before she started working at the office). The closest option is (C) 8am to 9am, but it doesn't fully cover the possible time window, so there isn't a perfect match in the given options. If there was an option for "11am to 1pm," that would be the correct answer.

However, since there is no such option, we can choose the most plausible time before her other activities start, which is (C) 8am to 9am. This is the best available answer given the choices.

The dance studio was closed after 10pm, so Mary couldn't have gone there during the time she was at the water park (1pm to 10pm). The only other possible time is between 10am to 12pm, before she started walking in the garden. Therefore, the answer is (D) 10am to 12pm.

From the given information, there is no specific time mentioned when David went to the clothing store. However, since the clothing store was closed after 3pm, David must have visited it before that time. The only available time slot before 3pm is between 10am and 3pm.

The museum closure time: 10pm.

Since the museum was closed after 10pm, Andrew couldn't have gone there between 10am to 10pm. The only time frame before the museum closed is from 11am to 8pm, but this includes the time when he was buying lunch. The exact time between 10am and 11am when he wasn't engaged in an activity outside the potential museum visit is not specified.

Therefore, the best answer is (D) 11am to 8pm, as it covers the time when Andrew could have potentially gone to the museum without conflicting with other activities. However, it's important to note that we don't have a specific time for Andrew to leave the deli, so this is an assumption based on the available information.

None of the given time periods between 5am and 10pm include a time when Leslie could have been at the beach because all their activities were elsewhere during those hours. The only possible time is between 10pm and the beach closing time, which is not an option provided in the choices. However, since the options do not cover this time, there is no definitive answer based on the given information. If there was an option for "10pm to 11pm," that would be the correct answer, but as it stands, there is no clear answer among the given choices.

The amusement park closure time: 10pm.
None of the provided timespan options include the time between 7pm to 9pm when Mary was working at the office. The earliest possible time Mary could have gone to the amusement park after her activities would be immediately after 6pm, when she finished getting coffee, until 9pm when she started working at the office. However, the amusement park would have been closed by then.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 7pm to 9pm, but since the park is closed after 9pm, it means she could have gone between 7pm and closing time. The exact end time is not specified in the options, but we can infer that it must be before 10pm since that's when the amusement park closes.

Answer: (D) 7pm to 10pm (assuming the park closes at 10pm exactly)

1pm-4pm: taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.
4pm-7pm: walking towards the Statue of Liberty.

Since the dance studio was closed after 7pm, and we don't have any activity between 12pm and 1pm, the only possible time window for Leslie to go to the dance studio before it closed would be between 10am and 12pm, which includes the time from 10am to 1pm.

However, option (C) "12pm to 1pm" only specifies one hour, while the dance studio could have been open from 10am to 12pm. So, the correct answer should include both 10am and 12pm. Therefore, the best answer is:

(C) 10am to 12pm

This is not an exact choice, but given the options, (C) is the closest since it encompasses the time Leslie could have gone to the dance studio before its closing.

The art studio closure time: 8pm.

Hannah cannot have gone to the art studio between 6am to 8am because she was at the library or cafe during that time. Similarly, she cannot have gone between 7pm to 8pm because she was walking towards the Statue of Liberty. The only available time for her to go to the art studio before it closed would be between 10am to 6pm, but since the studio is closed after 8pm, we should exclude the time from 8pm to 10pm as well.

Therefore, the correct answer is the time when she was not engaged in other activities, which is from 8am to 10am. However, since the studio was already closed by then, the actual time frame would be just before 8am, so the answer is:

(D) 8am to 10am (excluding the time from 8pm to close, which is not provided in the options).

The market closure time: 10pm.
William could not have gone to the market between 11am to 6pm because he was occupied with other activities during that time. The earliest possible time for him to go to the market would be after his last activity until the market closed, which is from 6pm to 10pm.

However, since the market is closed after 10pm, William could only have gone between 6pm to 10pm if he went immediately after his photo-taking session ended. So the correct answer is:

(C) 6pm to 9pm

The options (A) and (D) don't include the time when he might have gone to the market, and option (B) is after the market has already closed.

The only time when Sarah could have gone to the soccer field was between 9pm and closing time, which is not an option given. The closest option is 7pm to 9pm, even though the field was technically closed by then, but since the options don't include this, we cannot select a specific time range. However, if we had to choose the most likely time before the field was closed, it would be (D) 7pm to 9pm.

Answer: (D) 7pm to 9pm (assuming the question allows for a time just before closing, even if technically not within the official operating hours)
