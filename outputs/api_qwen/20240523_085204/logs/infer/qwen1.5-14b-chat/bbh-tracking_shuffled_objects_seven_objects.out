Let's track the partners for each character after each swap:

- Alice starts with Melissa, then switches with Fred: Alice-Fred, others remain the same.
- Gertrude and Eve switch: Alice-Fred, Gertrude-Eve, others remain the same.
- Gertrude and Alice switch: Alice-Gertrude, Fred-Eve, others remain the same.
- Bob and Alice switch: Alice-Bob, Gertrude-Eve, Fred-Eve, others remain the same.
- Dave and Fred switch: Alice-Bob, Gertrude-Eve, Dave-Fred, others remain the same.
- Eve and Alice switch: Alice-Eve, Bob-Gertrude, Dave-Fred, others remain the same.
- Eve and Claire switch: Alice-Eve, Bob-Gertrude, Dave-Fred, Claire-Lola, Gertrude-Jamie.

At the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with Jamie. So the answer is (D) Jamie.

We will go through the sequence of partner switches:

1. Dave and Claire switch: Dave: Jamie, Claire: Dave (Dave now dances with Jamie)
2. Alice and Eve switch: Alice: Eve, Eve: Alice (Eve dances with Alice)
3. Eve and Bob switch: Eve: Bob, Bob: Eve (Bob dances with Eve)
4. Claire and Bob switch: Bob: Claire, Claire: Eve (Claire dances with Eve, but Eve was just with Bob)
5. Fred and Eve switch: Eve: Fred, Fred: Claire (Fred dances with Claire, who was previously with Eve)
6. Gertrude and Dave switch: Dave: Gertrude, Gertrude: Fred (Gertrude dances with Fred, and Dave is now free)
7. Dave and Alice switch: Dave: Alice, Alice: Eve (Alice dances with Eve, who was previously with Dave)

At the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Alice. So the answer is not in the options provided. However, based on the logic, the correct answer would be (none of the above), as the options do not include Alice. If there's an option for "none" or "no partner," that would be the correct answer.
