We have two tables. The first one lists penguins, and the second one lists giraffes. The question asks how many animals in total are more than 5 years old.

For the penguins:
- Louis is 7 years old
- Bernard is 5 years old
- Vincent is 9 years old
- Gwen is 8 years old

So, out of the penguins, 3 (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen) are more than 5 years old.

For the giraffes:
- Jody is 5 years old
- Gladys is 10 years old
- Marian is 2 years old
- Donna is 9 years old

Out of the giraffes, 3 (Gladys, Donna, and Marian) are more than 5 years old.

Adding the penguins and giraffes that are more than 5 years old, we have 3 (penguins) + 3 (giraffes) = 6 animals.

The answer is (B) 6.

We already know the ages of the penguins: Louis is 7, Bernard is 5, Vincent is 9, and Gwen is 8. According to the information given, we can see that Louis (age 7) and Vincent (age 9) are older than Gwen (age 8). 

So, the penguins older than Gwen are Louis and Vincent. However, the question asks for only one option, and since we need to choose only one, we select the one that comes alphabetically after "Gwen" in the list.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Vincent.

This question asks for the cumulated age of the giraffes, which means we need to add up the ages of all the giraffes in the provided table:

Jody, 5 years old
Gladys, 10 years old
Marian, 2 years old
Donna, 9 years old

Adding these ages together: 
5 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 26 years

The cumulated age of the giraffes is 26 years. Therefore, the answer is (A) 26.

Before deleting Bernard, there were four penguins: Louis (7 years), Vincent (9 years), Gwen (8 years). After deleting Bernard, we have three penguins left: Louis (7 years), Vincent (9 years), and Gwen (8 years).

Now, we count the penguins who are more than 8 years old:
- Louis is 7 years old, so he doesn't count.
- Vincent is 9 years old, so he counts.
- Gwen is 8 years old, so she doesn't count.

There are only 1 penguin more than 8 years old after deleting Bernard.

So the answer is (A) 1.

First, let's consider the penguins before adding James and deleting Bernard:

- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 11 kg)
- Gwen (8 years, 15 kg)

After adding James (12 years, 12 kg):

- James (12 years, 12 kg)
- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 11 kg)
- Gwen (8 years, 15 kg)

Now, let's remove Bernard (5 years, 13 kg):

- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)
- Vincent (9 years, 11 kg)
- Gwen (8 years, 15 kg)
- James (12 years, 12 kg)

There are three penguins left: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. Of these, only Louis is less than 5 years old and weighs less than 12 kg. So, the penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg are Vincent and Gwen.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that meet these criteria.

The correct answer is (B).

To find the average height of all the penguins, we need to add up the heights of all penguins and then divide by the total number of penguins.

Here are the heights:
- Louis: 50 cm
- Bernard: 80 cm
- Vincent: 60 cm
- Gwen: 70 cm
- James: 90 cm

Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70 + 90
Total height = 350 cm

There are 5 penguins in total (including the newly added James).

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins
Average height = 350 cm / 5
Average height = 70 cm

So the correct answer is (C) 70.

To find the cumulated weight of all the penguins, we need to add up the weights from the original table and the new penguin, James.

Original weights:
- Louis: 11 kg
- Bernard: 13 kg
- Vincent: 11 kg
- Gwen: 15 kg

New penguin, James:
- Weight: 12 kg

Cumulative weight = (Louis's weight) + (Bernard's weight) + (Vincent's weight) + (Gwen's weight) + (James's weight)
Cumulative weight = 11 + 13 + 11 + 15 + 12

Let's calculate this sum:
Cumulative weight = 62 kg

This question focuses on age. According to the table, Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old. James is not mentioned in the original table but since he is added later and has an age of 12, he is also more than 8 years old.

Out of these, Louis, Vincent, and James are more than 8 years old.

So there are 3 penguins that are more than 8 years old. The answer is (C).

- Bernard (age 5, weight 13 kg)
- Vincent (age 9, weight 11 kg)
- Gwen (age 8, weight 15 kg)

Adding James to the table:

- James (age 12, weight 12 kg)

Now, let's count penguins that meet both criteria:
- Bernard is 5 years old but has a weight of 13 kg, so he doesn't meet the first condition.
- Vincent is 9 years old and has a weight of 11 kg, so he doesn't meet the second condition.
- Gwen is 8 years old but has a weight of 15 kg, so she doesn't meet the first condition either.
- James is 12 years old and has a weight of 12 kg, which means he meets both conditions.

The question asks about the number of species, but since the table only provides information about individual penguins with their names, ages, heights, and weights, it does not contain any information about species. Therefore, based on the given data, we cannot determine the number of species.

However, if we assume that all penguins in the table belong to the same species (which is common), then the answer would be (A) 1, because there is no indication of different species in the provided data.

If the question was about the number of unique species mentioned, and we knew that these were penguins from different species, we would need more context or additional information to provide an answer. With the given information, the correct answer is (A) 1.

Now, to find the oldest penguin, we compare the ages:
- Louis is 7 years old
- Vincent is 9 years old
- Gwen is 8 years old
- James is 12 years old

James is the oldest penguin after Bernard is removed from the table. So the answer is (E) James.

The question asks for the name of the penguin with a height of 0.6 meters. First, we need to convert the height given in centimeters (cm) to meters (m). Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, we divide the height in centimeters by 100.

Louis is 50 cm tall, which is not 0.6 m.
Bernard is 80 cm tall, which is not 0.6 m.
Vincent is 60 cm tall, which is equal to 0.6 m when converted.
Gwen is 70 cm tall, which is not 0.6 m.

Therefore, the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin is Vincent. The correct answer is (C).

To find the average height, we sum up the heights and divide by the number of penguins:

(50 + 60 + 70) / 3 = 180 / 3 = 60 cm

After deleting Bernard, there are only three penguins left (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen). Their combined height is still 180 cm, so the average remains the same since it's calculated based on the total height and not the count.

Therefore, the average height of the penguins after deleting Bernard is also 60 cm.

Since the question asks for the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order, we only need to consider the penguins from the first table, as the second table is about giraffes and not relevant to this part of the question.

The penguins in alphabetical order are Bernard, Gwen, Louis, and Vincent. The last one in alphabetical order would be the one that comes after Vincent, which is Louis.

The name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Louis. So the answer is (A).

First, let's consider the penguins before adding or deleting any:
- Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Vincent is 9 years old but we don't have his weight, only that it's 11 kg.

After adding James, who is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg:
- Louis is still 7 years old and 11 kg.
- Vincent is still 9 years old but 11 kg.

Now, we delete Bernard (5 years old, 13 kg).

The penguins less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg are:
- Louis (7 years, 11 kg)

There is only 1 penguin that meets these criteria.

So the answer is (A) 1.

We need to find the name of the penguin that comes right before the last one when sorted alphabetically. Since the names are already listed in alphabetical order, we don't have to sort them again. The penguins, sorted alphabetically, are Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.

The next to last penguin, after Vincent, would be Louis.

So the answer is (A) Louis.

- Vincent: 9 years
- Gwen: 8 years

After deleting Bernard, we have three penguins left:
- Louis: 7 years
- Vincent: 9 years
- Gwen: 8 years

To find the cumulated age, we add up their ages:
7 + 9 + 8 = 24 years

So the cumulated age of the penguins after deleting Bernard is 24 years. The correct answer is (A).

Initially, there were four penguins: Louis (7 years), Vincent (9 years), Gwen (8 years), and Bernard (5 years). After adding James (12 years) and then deleting Bernard, we have:

- Louis (7)
- Vincent (9)
- Gwen (8)

The question asks for the name of the last animal, but it refers to a table listing giraffes, not penguins. The given options are all penguin names. Since the question specifically mentions a "similar table" with giraffes, we can assume that the correct answer is not among the penguin names provided.

Looking at the giraffe table:

First, we have four penguins before adding James and deleting Bernard:

- Louis: weight = 11 kg
- Vincent: weight = 11 kg
- Gwen: weight = 15 kg
- James: weight = 12 kg (not yet added)

After adding James but before deleting Bernard, the total weight would be:
Louis + Vincent + Gwen + James = 11 + 11 + 15 + 12 = 49 kg

However, since we're asked for the cumulated weight after deleting Bernard, we remove Bernard's weight from the total:
49 kg (current total) - Bernard's weight (13 kg) = 49 - 13 = 36 kg

But there's a mistake in the options provided because option (C) 50 kg is not among the choices. The correct answer should be 36 kg after removing Bernard. Since there's no 36 in the options, it seems there might be an error in the question or the options given. Assuming the question is asking for the total weight after removing Bernard and including James, the answer would be 37 kg if we consider Louis, Vincent, Gwen, and James together without considering the weights as cumulative (since James is added and Bernard is removed separately).

If the question was intended to ask for the total weight after both actions (addition and deletion), then the correct answer would be 49 kg, which is before removing Bernard, as James has not yet been included in the cumulative weight.

Given the options, the most reasonable interpretation, assuming no error, would be (B) 49 kg since it includes all the penguins before removing Bernard. However, if the question is asking for the final total after both actions, it should be 37 kg, which is not listed.

We have the weights of the penguins as follows:
- Louis: 11 kg
- Vincent: 11 kg
- Gwen: 15 kg

After deleting Bernard, we only need to add the weights of Louis, Vincent, and Gwen together to find the cumulated weight:

11 kg (Louis) + 11 kg (Vincent) + 15 kg (Gwen) = 37 kg

So, the cumulated weight of the penguins after deleting Bernard is 37 kg. The correct option is (A) 37.

The question asks for the oldest penguin after deleting Bernard. Before deletion, we had Louis (7), Vincent (9), and Gwen (8) as the penguins with ages. Since Bernard was the youngest (age 5), removing him leaves us with:

- Louis (7)
- Vincent (9)
- Gwen (8)

Among these, Vincent has the highest age, which is 9 years. Therefore, Vincent is the oldest penguin after deleting Bernard.

The answer is (C) Vincent.

To find the average height of the penguins, we need to add up the heights of all the penguins and then divide by the number of penguins.

Louis' height = 50 cm
Bernard's height = 80 cm
Vincent's height = 60 cm
Gwen's height = 70 cm

Total height = Louis + Bernard + Vincent + Gwen
Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70

Now, let's calculate the sum:
Total height = 260 cm

There are 4 penguins, so we divide the total height by 4 to find the average:

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins
Average height = 260 cm / 4

Let's do the division:
Average height = 65 cm

So the correct answer is (B) 65.

- Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm
- Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm
- Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm

Comparing these, Bernard has a younger age (5) and a taller height (80 cm) than Gwen (age 8 and height 70 cm).

So the correct answer is (B) Bernard.

This question asks for the name of the first penguin when sorted alphabetically. Since the names are already listed in alphabetical order from A to Z, the first name on the list would be the one that comes first alphabetically.

The names in the table are: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen.

The name of the first penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Louis.

So the answer is (A).

The given information does not specify the gender of any penguin. Therefore, based on the provided table, we cannot determine which penguin is female. The options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) represent names without gender information. Without additional data, the answer is unknown.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which penguin has the highest weight?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's look at the weight column for each penguin:
- Louis: 11 kg
- Bernard: 13 kg
- Vincent: 11 kg
- Gwen: 15 kg

Gwen has the highest weight among the listed penguins. So the correct answer is (D).

To find the penguin that is taller than the others, we need to compare the height values from the given information. 

Here are the heights:
- Louis: 50 cm
- Bernard: 80 cm
- Vincent: 60 cm
- Gwen: 70 cm

From this list, Bernard has the tallest height at 80 cm.

So the correct answer is (B) Bernard.

We already have the names of the penguins in the original table: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. When we add James, the list becomes:

1. Louis
2. Bernard
3. Vincent
4. Gwen
5. James

To find the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order, we simply look at the names in the order they appear: Bernard, Gwen, James, Louis, Vincent.

So, the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Vincent.

The answer is (C).
