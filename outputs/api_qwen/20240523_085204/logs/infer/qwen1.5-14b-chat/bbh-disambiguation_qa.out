In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the conjunction "because," which suggests that it refers to the subject that preceded it, which is "the patient." Therefore, "he" is referring to the patient who had a rare skin condition. So the correct antecedent for "he" is:

(A) The patient had a skin condition

The answer is not (B) because the specialist is not the antecedent for "he" in this context, and there is no ambiguity about the reference, so the answer is not (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. We have two potential antecedents for "he": the scientist and the artist. The sentence structure suggests that the collaboration between these two individuals is being described, and the action of sharing a story follows the verb "collaborated."

Since the verb "shared" is in the past tense, it implies that whoever performed the action of sharing a story did so after the collaboration. Given that the collaboration is typically followed by the sharing of ideas or experiences, it's more likely that the person who collaborated would be the one sharing a story, rather than the other party.

Therefore, the most logical antecedent for "he" is the scientist, as they are the subject who collaborated with the artist. So the answer is:

(A) The scientist shared a story

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "she" typically refers to a female subject, and in this context, it's clear that the subject using "big words" is the one causing difficulty in communication. The developer is the other person in the sentence, and it wouldn't make sense for the developer to use big words to communicate with themselves. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" must be the writer, who is the other party involved in the communication.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer uses big words
  1%|█                                                                                      | 3/250 [01:10<1:39:07, 24.08s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the conjunction "and." The conjunction indicates that the subject of the second clause should be the same as the subject of the first clause. Since the first clause is "The scientist will collaborate with the artist," the antecedent of "he" should logically be the scientist, as they are the subject of the first part of the sentence.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is (A) The scientist will share a story.

So the answer is (A).

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent for "their" could be either Bailey's or the director's since both are singular nouns that can possess an office. The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine which one it is.

Therefore, the pronoun "their" is ambiguous, and the answer is (C). Without additional context, we cannot say whether it is Bailey's office or the director's office.
  2%|█▋                                                                                     | 5/250 [02:11<1:57:07, 28.68s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "she" refers back to. Here, there are two potential antecedents: "the developer" and "the designer." Since the verb "liked" is in the past tense, it implies an action performed by one of these two individuals. 

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the argument is related to liking the design. If "she" refers to the developer, then the argument would be because the developer liked the design, which is not a typical cause for an argument between them. On the other hand, if "she" refers to the designer, then the argument could make sense, as the designer might like their own design and be defending it against the developer's disagreement.

Given the context and the likely scenario of a designer defending their work, the most logical antecedent for "she" in this sentence is "the designer." Therefore, the answer is:

(B) The designer liked the design.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female subject, we need to look for a female subject in the previous clause that could be too late. The only female subject mentioned is "the witness," so the antecedent of "she" is most likely the witness. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The witness was too late.
  3%|██▍                                                                                    | 7/250 [03:13<1:59:32, 29.52s/it]================================================================================================================================
In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what or whom "them" refers to. The antecedent for "them" must be a noun that could be asked to perform an action. The sentence structure suggests that the guard is performing an action (calling) and then asking someone else to do something (open the door).

The verb "called" indicates that the guard is the one initiating the communication. Since the action of opening the door follows the call, it is logical to assume that the person being asked to open the door would be the recipient of the request. Therefore, "them" refers to the person who is being called, which is the cleaner.

So the correct antecedent for "them" is:

(B) Asked the cleaner

Hence, the answer is (B), and the pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

The pronoun "he" in this sentence could potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist since the previous clause mentions that they are collaborating. Without additional context to disambiguate, the antecedent of "he" is unclear. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  4%|███▏                                                                                   | 9/250 [04:00<1:44:15, 25.96s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "his" could potentially refer to either the customer or the chef since both are people and could have culinary training. The sentence structure does not provide enough context to definitively determine which person the pronoun is referring to. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. The correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  4%|███▍                                                                                  | 10/250 [04:26<1:43:51, 25.96s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The antecedent of "he" must be the noun that the pronoun logically refers to based on the context provided. Here, the sentence says "The mechanic disliked the cashier because _ is arrogant." The pronoun "he" comes after the clause "the cashier," and the reason for the dislike is given by the pronoun referring to someone being arrogant. Since the pronoun "he" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause, in this case, it would refer to the person who is disliked. Given the options, "The mechanic" is the subject of the clause "disliked," so the correct antecedent for "he" is the mechanic.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) The cashier is arrogant

However, if the pronoun "he" were meant to refer to the mechanic, it would be an error, as the mechanic is not described as arrogant in the sentence. But since the context strongly suggests that "he" refers to the cashier, the answer should be (B). If there were ambiguity due to a possible interpretation of "he" as referring to the mechanic, it would be an unusual use of the pronoun, and the intended meaning would likely be clear from the context. In this case, the ambiguity is minimal, and the most logical interpretation is (B).
  4%|███▊                                                                                  | 11/250 [04:54<1:45:41, 26.53s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, "Bailey planned to meet the director at his office," the pronoun "his" is used to indicate possession. Since "his" typically refers to a male possessive pronoun, we need to consider whether it refers to Bailey or the director. 

If "his" refers to Bailey, the sentence would mean that Bailey plans to meet the director at Bailey's office. This is unlikely, as it's not common for someone to refer to their own office as "his" in this context.

If "his" refers to the director, the sentence would mean that Bailey plans to meet the director at the director's office, which is more plausible because people usually use "his" to indicate someone else's property or belongings.

Given the options, the most accurate interpretation of the sentence is that it is ambiguous because both possibilities exist, and without additional context, we cannot definitively determine whose office is meant. Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Ambiguous
  5%|████▏                                                                                 | 12/250 [05:22<1:47:27, 27.09s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the subject of the verb "told," and it refers to the person who received the fake story. The antecedent of "them" must be the person mentioned immediately before it, which is "salesperson." Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the writer told the salesperson a fake story.

So the answer is (B) Told the salesperson a fake story. The antecedent is unambiguous in this case.
  5%|████▍                                                                                 | 13/250 [05:48<1:45:39, 26.75s/it]================================================================================================================================
The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support" refers to a shared possession or group. Since "the writer" is mentioned alongside "their friends," it is logical to assume that "their" refers to the writer's friends, as the writer would be the one requiring support to publish the story.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "their" in this context is:

(A) They were the writer's friends

So, the answer is (A). The sentence is not ambiguous with respect to the antecedent of the pronoun "their."

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "gave." Since "gave" is a verb that typically follows a direct object, the antecedent of "her" must be the noun that is receiving the action. In this case, that noun is "the housekeeper," as the chief is giving something to the housekeeper. Therefore, the correct interpretation of "gave her some tips" is that the housekeeper is receiving the tips.

So the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is "the housekeeper." The answer is (B).
  6%|█████▏                                                                                | 15/250 [06:37<1:39:05, 25.30s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "they" refers to the subject of the verb "had purchased," which is typically understood to be the noun immediately preceding the pronoun. Here, that noun is "the house." So the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the house" and not "the homeowner" or "the inspector." Therefore, option (A) is the correct choice.

The sentence can be rephrased to make it clearer: "The homeowner asked the inspector if the house (that the homeowner had purchased) was structurally sound."

Hence, the answer is:

(A) The homeowner had purchased

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to connect back to a subject. We need to identify what "he" refers to since there are two potential antecedents: "the developer" and "the writer." The verb "focuses on code" provides context, but it's unclear whether it describes the person unable to communicate or the other person.

The sentence suggests that the inability to communicate is due to focusing on code, which is typically associated with the developer's role, as they are the ones responsible for coding. However, without additional information, it's not definitively clear if "he" refers to the developer or the writer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous, as it's not possible to definitively determine the antecedent based on the information provided.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer back to one of two possible antecedents: the supervisor or the employee. The key phrase to focus on is "stellar performance," which typically refers to the accomplishment or work being evaluated. Since the feedback is given by the supervisor to the employee, it's logical to assume that the "stellar performance" being referred to is that of the employee, as the supervisor would be providing feedback on their work.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "his" is the employee's performance. So the answer is (B).
  7%|██████▏                                                                               | 18/250 [08:09<1:55:42, 29.93s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to determine what it refers to, either the lawyer or the cashier. The antecedent for "he" should be the subject that performs the action of needing to understand the case. 

The clause "because he needed to understand the case" explains the motivation for the lawyer's action, which is looking into the illegal accusations. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" in this context is the lawyer, as it makes sense that the lawyer would need to understand the case, not the cashier.

So the correct answer is (A) The lawyer needed to understand. The pronoun "he" is not ambiguous in this case.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The sentence structure suggests that someone is calling to inform another person about their car. Since the pronoun "his" is used after the verb "be," it is more likely to refer to the subject that follows it, which is "the customer" in this context.

The sentence reads: "The mechanic called to inform the customer that the customer's car would be ready in the morning." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is the customer's car.

So the correct answer is:

(B) It was the customer's car.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the verb "were repairing." We need to identify who is doing the repairing based on the context provided. The sentence starts with "The worker told the pedestrian," so it's likely that the subject of the修理动作 is related to the person being informed.

Given that "the worker" is mentioned first, it is more reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the worker, since the action of repairing is logically connected to the subject who is giving the information.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is:

(A) The worker was repairing

So the answer is (A).
  8%|███████▏                                                                              | 21/250 [09:26<1:43:46, 27.19s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. We need to consider both the taxpayer and the accountant as potential antecedents for "they." The sentence can be interpreted in two ways:

1. If "they" refers to the taxpayer: "The taxpayer met with the accountant to find out if the taxpayer could help with tax preparation."
2. If "they" refers to the accountant: "The taxpayer met with the accountant to find out if the accountant could help with tax preparation."

Both interpretations are grammatically correct, but the intended meaning would depend on the context. Without additional context, we cannot definitively say which person "they" refers to. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "liked" is the clue to determine who is performing the action. The sentence structure is: "The developer argued with the designer because _ liked the design."

Since "he" follows the conjunction "because," it refers to the reason for the argument. The argument was made by the developer, so it's logical that the person who liked the design would be the one who prompted the argument. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the developer.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The developer liked the design
  9%|███████▉                                                                              | 23/250 [10:17<1:37:51, 25.87s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "they" appears after a clause that describes an action ("always teaching the assistant new techniques"). The pronoun "they" is typically used to refer back to the subject of the previous clause, which in this case is "the cook." Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "they" is "The cook," as it makes sense for the cook to enjoy teaching others.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The cook likes to teach

This means that the ambiguity in the sentence lies within the sentence structure, not in the antecedent, since it's clear that "they" refers to the cook. However, if the intended meaning was to imply that both the cook and the assistant like to teach, the sentence would be ambiguous. Since the sentence only suggests the cook's preference, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used after the clause "because," which provides context for what the pronoun is referring to. The clause "because he is an expert on rare skin conditions" explains the reason for the referral. Since "he" is placed after "the specialist," it is most logical that "he" refers to the specialist, as the specialist is the one being described as an expert on rare skin conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The specialist is an expert

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to determine who "she" is referring to, either the technician or the customer. Since the verb "completed" typically implies the action of the subject, we can look at the context to decide.

The sentence structure is "The technician told the customer that _ had completed the repair." Here, "she" is used after the verb "had completed," which suggests that "she" is the subject of the action. Given that the technician is the one telling the customer about the completion of the repair, it is logical to assume that the pronoun "she" refers to the technician.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The technician completed the repair. The pronoun "she" is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the person who received the prototype. The antecedent for "him" must be the person the carpenter collaborated with and gave something to. Since the carpenter collaborated with the designer, it is logical that "him" would refer to the designer, as the designer is the one receiving the prototype.

So the correct answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype. The sentence implies that the carpenter gave the prototype to the designer, not to themselves. Therefore, the pronoun "him" is unambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they." The pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the secretary or the developer based on the context. The clause "because they better understood the problem" gives us a clue about the person who has a superior understanding.

Let's analyze the two possibilities:

1. If "they" refers to "the secretary," the sentence would mean: "The secretary corrected the developer because the secretary better understood the problem."
2. If "they" refers to "the developer," the sentence would mean: "The secretary corrected the developer because the developer better understood the problem."

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical for "they" to refer to the person who is better understood the problem, as the secretary is performing an action (correcting) based on that understanding. Therefore, it is more likely that "they" refers to the secretary. However, without additional context, it's not absolutely clear, and the pronoun could be interpreted as referring to either party.

So the answer is (C) Ambiguous, but with a slight lean towards the secretary if we assume the sentence structure implies the secretary's superior understanding.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the key to determining its antecedent. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the undergraduate applying to work with the scientist is because of a need for a lab assistant. The antecedent of "he" must be the person who needs the assistant, which is typically the subject performing the action. Since the undergraduate is the subject who is applying, it is logical that "he" refers to the undergraduate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The scientist needed an assistant

The undergraduate is applying to help the scientist, so it's not the undergraduate who needs an assistant, but rather the scientist. Thus, the pronoun "he" is ambiguous if we don't have additional context, but based on the sentence provided, it refers to the scientist.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is the key to identifying the antecedent. Since "stellar performance" is typically associated with the person being evaluated, it's logical to assume that the feedback pertains to the person who performed well. In this context, "their" is most likely referring to the employee, as "the employee" is the one receiving the feedback. Therefore, the antecedent is "It was the employee's performance."

So the correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what it is referring to since it could potentially refer to either the salesperson or the writer. The verb "sold" suggests an action directed towards someone, and the context indicates that the salesperson is attempting to deceive. Therefore, it is logical that the person being fooled and subsequently sold something would be the target of the deception.

The correct antecedent for "them" in this context is the person who is being fooled, which is the writer. So the answer is:

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

The sentence does not suggest that the salesperson is being sold anything, so option (A) is incorrect. The pronoun is unambiguous in this case, referring to the writer, not the salesperson.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he". The pronoun "he" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause or action. The subject of the first part of the sentence is "the driver," and the second part starts with "after he broke a window." Since "he" comes after the word "after," it logically refers to the person whose action comes immediately before it, which in this case is "broke a window."

The verb "broke" is in the past tense, so it must be referring to an action that occurred before the main clause, "The driver yelled at the tailor." Given that, the only option that fits is:

(B) The tailor broke a window

So the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the tailor." The answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is typically the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun is replacing or referring to. Here, "he" could potentially refer to either "the visitor" or "the teacher," depending on the intended meaning.

Option A suggests that "he" refers to the visitor, which would mean the visitor liked the cake.
Option B suggests that "he" refers to the teacher, which would mean the teacher liked the cake.

Since the sentence structure does not provide enough context to determine which person specifically liked the cake, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the conjunction "and". Since "she" typically refers to the person mentioned immediately before it, and "the scientist" is the subject immediately before "she", it is most likely that "she" refers to the scientist. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the scientist.

So the correct answer is:
(A) The scientist will share a story

This means option (B) is incorrect because the artist is not the antecedent of "she" in this context, and option (C) is incorrect because there is no ambiguity about the antecedent of "she" in this sentence.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is used after the action "asked." The verb "asked" is the key to understanding the antecedent, as it is the main action being performed. The antecedent for "him" must be the person who could receive feedback. Since the designer is the one asking for feedback, the logical antecedent for "him" in this context is the cook, as the cook is the one being asked for input.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the cook

The sentence implies that the designer asked the cook for feedback, so there is no ambiguity here.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used, and we need to identify what it is referring to. The antecedent could be either "parent" or "secretary." Let's analyze both possibilities:

1. If "his" refers to "parent": "My parent called the secretary for more information." Here, "his" implies that the parent has a secretary, and the secretary is the one being contacted. So, option A ("They were my parent's secretary") fits this interpretation.

2. If "his" refers to "secretary": "My parent called his secretary for more information." In this case, "his" suggests that the parent is calling someone else's secretary, which is less common, but still possible if there's a shared secretary or if the parent knows another person's secretary well enough.

Given the ambiguity in the sentence, it's not clear whether "his" refers to the parent's secretary or someone else's secretary. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

Here, we need to determine who the pronoun "she" refers to. In the sentence, there are two potential antecedents for "she": the janitor and the child. Let's analyze each possibility:

1. If "she" refers to the janitor: The sentence would read, "The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise the janitor would have to mop it all over again." This makes sense, as the janitor is the one responsible for mopping the floor.

2. If "she" refers to the child: The sentence would read, "The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise the child would have to mop it all over again." This doesn't make much sense, as the child is unlikely to be the one mopping the floor.

Since the context suggests that the janitor is the one who has the responsibility of mopping, it is more logical that "she" refers to the janitor. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining its antecedent. The sentence structure suggests that "she" is providing a reason for why the developer couldn't communicate with the writer. Given the context, it's logical that "she" refers to the person who is focusing on code, as this is the activity that could prevent communication. Since "the writer" is the other person mentioned in the sentence, the antecedent of "she" must be the person who is not the developer, which is the writer.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (B) The writer focuses on code.

Final Answer: (B) The writer focuses on code.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent for "they" must be the subject of the previous clause that refers to someone working on the house. Since the sentence begins with "The carpenter told," it's logical to assume that "they" would refer back to the carpenter, as the carpenter is the one doing the action of working on the house.

Therefore, the antecedent for "they" is "the carpenter." So the correct answer is:

The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support" could potentially refer to either the writer's friends or the friends referred to collectively by "her friends." The context suggests that the writer is involved in the publication process, so it's more logical that "their" refers to the writer's friends, as they are directly related to the story's publication. However, without additional context, we cannot be completely certain.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

(D) Ambiguous

The sentence is ambiguous because it's not clear whether "their" refers to the writer's friends or the friends of the writer's friends.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "the physician," which suggests that "they" is most likely referring back to the physician, as the subject of the second clause. The verb "could borrow" is also associated with the subject that came before it, which is "the physician" in this case. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the physician.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is the subject of the verb "asked." We need to identify who "them" refers to based on the context provided. The sentence has two possible subjects that could be asking someone else to do something: "the cleaner" and "the guard." 

The verb "called" indicates that one person is contacting another. Since "called" is followed by "and asked them," it suggests that the action of asking is connected to the person who was called. Therefore, it is more logical that "them" refers to the person who was called, which in this case is "the guard."

So the correct antecedent for the pronoun "them" is:

(B) Asked the guard

Hence, the answer is (B). The sentence is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" must refer to someone who is doing the action of standing in front of the door, as that is the reason for the greeting. The antecedent must be the person who is performing the action of standing. Since "the mechanic greets the receptionist," it is logical that the person standing in front of the door is the one who is greeted, which would typically be the person entering or exiting. Therefore, the most appropriate antecedent for "he" is the person who is greeting, which is the mechanic. So the correct answer is:

(A) The mechanic is standing in front of the door.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used after the word "discuss," which implies that someone's grading policy is being discussed. The two possible antecedents for "his" are "the educator" and "the student," since each could potentially have a grading policy. However, the context of "meeting with a student" suggests that the student is more likely to be the one whose grading policy would be discussed.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "was too late." We need to determine which of the two possible antecedents (the investigator or the witness) "he" could be referring to.

The first clause states that the investigator wanted to interview the witness. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that "he" in the second clause refers to the subject of the first clause, which is the investigator. So the antecedent of "he" is the investigator.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. We need to determine who needs to understand the case. The context suggests that the lawyer is looking into illegal accusations against the cashier, so the lawyer's actions are the focus.

The verb "needed" implies a motivation or purpose for the action. Since the lawyer is the one performing the investigation, it is logical that the pronoun "they" refers to the lawyer, as the lawyer is the subject of the sentence.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is typically the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun replaces. Here, "he" refers back to a male subject. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the nurse running is related to the smell, which is why the antecedent is likely to be someone with an awful smell. Since "smelled awful" is a description that would logically apply to the laborer, given the context, we can conclude that "he" refers to the laborer.

The pronoun "their" in the sentence "This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support" can be ambiguous, as it could potentially refer to either the writer or the writer's friends. We can analyze the options:

(A) If "they" refers to "the writer's friends," it would mean that the writer and their friends' support is necessary for publication.
(B) If "they" refers to "the friends' friends," it implies that the support of the friends of the friends is needed for publication.
(C) "They" cannot refer to the story's friends because a story does not have friends in this context.

Given the context, the most likely antecedent for "their" is either the writer or the writer's friends, so the answer is (D) Ambiguous, as it's unclear whether "they" refers to the writer or the friends without further context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "met" suggests that someone is having a meeting, and "because" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship. Since "her" comes after "the designer," it is most likely referring to the designer's idea, as designers typically have ideas that need to be implemented.

The first clause is "The sheriff protected the writer." Since the sheriff is a person capable of protecting someone, it is reasonable to assume that the sheriff is the one performing the action of protecting.

Since the context is about a mechanic informing a customer, it's reasonable to assume that "her" is referring to the customer, not the mechanic, as the mechanic is the one calling to inform the customer. Therefore, the antecedent for "her" is the customer's car.

So the correct answer is:

(B) It was the customer's car.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" appears after the action "gave." The antecedent of the pronoun must be the person who received the action of giving. Since the sentence states that the carpenter made a desk for the clerk and then "gave them a discount," it is logical that "them" refers to the clerk, as the clerk is the one receiving the discount. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(B) Gave the clerk a discount

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to refer back to one of the two nouns mentioned earlier, "mechanic" or "cashier." Since the sentence states that the mechanic disliked the cashier due to a quality attributed to "they," it is logical to assume that the pronoun is referring to the person who is being disliked for the described trait. Therefore, "they" refers to the cashier, as the mechanic is the subject expressing the dislike and wouldn't be described as arrogant.

So the answer is (B) The cashier is arrogant.

The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun "she" is referring to the person who has a better understanding of the problem. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject that follows "because" and explains why the developer corrected the secretary. In this case, "the secretary" is the one who is better understood to have the problem understanding. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is "the secretary."

So the answer is (B). The secretary understood the problem.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to in the context of the sentence. The antecedent of "her" can be either Bailey or the director, as "her" is commonly used to refer to a female individual. Since the sentence states that Bailey planned to meet the director, it is more likely that "her" refers to the director, as Bailey is the one doing the action of planning the meeting.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(A) The office was the director's office

This is because Bailey would meet the director at the director's office, not their own. So, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is ambiguous, but based on the context, we can infer that it refers to the director. The most appropriate answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "discuss" suggests that both the customer and the chef are involved in the conversation. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun indicating ownership or association, it could potentially refer to either the customer or the chef. However, culinary training is generally associated with chefs, so it's more likely that the discussion pertains to the chef's training.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

Without additional context, it's not clear whether "her" refers to the customer or the chef, so the antecedent is ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who is being described as an expert on rare skin conditions. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject that follows "because," which is "the specialist" in this case. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for referring the patient to the specialist is because the specialist has expertise.

So the correct answer is (B) The specialist is an expert.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both mentioned as individuals who will be discussing something. The pronoun "their" typically refers to both of these people when used together, indicating shared possession or experience. Since "favorite dishes" is a common topic for both a reporter and a chef, it's reasonable to assume that they would be discussing each other's favorites.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is both the reporter and the chef, as they will be discussing each other's favorite dishes. So the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous - although this choice is less precise than it could be, it still acknowledges that the pronoun can be understood to refer to both individuals equally. A more accurate response might be "(B) They will discuss both the reporter's and the chef's favorite dishes."

The pronoun "she" in this sentence is ambiguous because it could refer to either the scientist or the artist. The sentence structure does not provide enough information to definitively determine who "she" is. Since there is no clear antecedent, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "because they used big words." To determine the antecedent, we need to find out who would logically use big words in the context of communication problems. Since the first part of the sentence states that "the developer was unable to communicate with the writer," it is most reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the person who is causing the communication barrier, which would be the writer in this case.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the writer." The correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. We have two possible referents for "her": the pathologist and the victim. Since the pathologist is typically the one who would use a microscope for examining tissue samples, it is logical to assume that "her" refers to the pathologist. Therefore, the antecedent for "her microscope" is the pathologist's.

So the correct answer is (A) It was the pathologist's microscope. The sentence does not imply that the victim has their own microscope in this context.

The pronoun "he" in the sentence "Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor" is ambiguous without additional context. It could potentially refer to either Alex or Taylor. If "he" refers to Alex, the sentence would mean that before Alex sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor. If "he" refers to Taylor, the sentence would suggest that before Taylor sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor. Without more context, we cannot definitively determine the antecedent.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "disclosed" suggests that someone is sharing information, and "had a history of substance abuse" is the information being disclosed. Since the patient is typically the one sharing personal information like this with a counselor, it is logical that "he" refers to the patient.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(A) The patient had a history

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female person, and "the secretary" is the only female person mentioned in the context provided, the most logical interpretation is that "she" refers to the secretary. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "The secretary."

So the correct answer is:

(B) The secretary made a mistake.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is the key to determining the antecedent. The possible antecedents for "their" are "producers" because "producers" is the noun that could logically own an office. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the office referred to belongs to the producers. So the antecedent of "their" is the producers.

The sentence suggests that after meeting with the producers, Sam went to the office that belongs to them. This aligns with option (A): The office was the producers' office.

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the subject of the second verb "told". The antecedent of the pronoun "him" should be the noun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, "him" is referring to the person who was fooled by the fake story. The antecedent is the person being fooled, which in this context is the salesperson, not the writer. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "him" is the salesperson.

So the answer is (B) Told the salesperson a fake story.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine what "them" refers to. The antecedent is the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun is replacing. The antecedent must be someone who could receive a prototype. Here, there are two possible referents: the carpenter and the designer.

- If "them" refers to the carpenter, the sentence would mean: "The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave the carpenter a prototype."
- If "them" refers to the designer, the sentence would mean: "The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave the designer a prototype."

The sentence doesn't provide enough context to clearly indicate whether "them" refers to the carpenter or the designer. Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" appears after the verb "gave." To determine the antecedent, we look at the previous part of the sentence where there is an action that can logically be performed on someone. The antecedent for "him" must be the person who received the action. Here, "the carpenter made a desk for the clerk" implies that the carpenter is the one doing the action. So, when the carpenter gives something (a discount), it is logical to assume that "him" refers to the clerk, as the clerk is the one receiving the gift.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "him" is the clerk. The answer is (B). The sentence means that the carpenter gave a discount to the clerk.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" is the subject that precedes it and must logically fit the context. The two possible subjects that could be the antecedent for "she" are "the lawyer" and "the cashier". However, the verb "needed" implies an action or requirement, and since understanding the case is a logical reason for looking into illegal accusations, it is more likely that the person doing the understanding would be the one needing to do it.

Therefore, the antecedent of "she" in this context is "the lawyer." So the correct answer is:

(A) The lawyer needed to understand

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "could pay." The context suggests that someone is giving information about payment options to another person. Since the technician is the one providing the information, it is logical that "they" would be referring to the person who has the ability to pay, which is typically the customer.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" in this case is the customer. So the correct answer is:

(B) The customer could pay

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after "because." The antecedent of "they" must be determined based on the context. The two possible antecedents for "they" are "the librarian" and "the CEO." The sentence structure suggests that the librarian is helping the CEO, so it's logical that the action of asking for the book would be connected to the person needing assistance.

The part "to find the book because they asked" implies that someone asked for the book, and since the librarian is helping, it's more likely that it was the person who needed help, which is the CEO, who asked. Therefore, the antecedent for "they" is the CEO.

So the answer is (B) The CEO asked.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" appears after the coordinating conjunction "and," which suggests that it is referring to the subject that comes before it.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining its antecedent. The sentence structure is "The assistant asked the physician if [subject] needs any help." Since "she" is typically used to refer to females, the most likely antecedent for "she" in this context is "the physician," as it's more common for an assistant to ask a physician if they need assistance.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "she" is the physician. So the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "needed to get more rest." The antecedent of the pronoun must be the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is referring to. The sentence structure suggests that the warning is being directed towards someone, which is why it's most likely that "they" refers to the patient, as the surgeon is the one issuing the warning.

So the correct antecedent for "they" is the patient, which corresponds to option (B).

Answer: (B) The patient needed more rest.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the surgeon or the nurse, since both are mentioned as people who could need more time. The verb "warned" suggests that someone is giving a cautionary statement to another person, but without additional context, it's not clear who the warning is directed towards. Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The possible antecedents for "he" are the worker and the pedestrian, as they are both mentioned before the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that someone is giving advice to another person. Since "told" implies communication from one person to another, the pronoun "he" is likely referring to the person receiving the advice.

The sentence is "The worker told the pedestrian that he should avoid the closed portion of the street." Here, "he" refers to the person who needs to take action based on the advice, which is the person being advised. Therefore, in this context, "he" refers to the pedestrian.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was in a good mood." We need to determine whose mood it is referring to. The antecedent for the pronoun "he" should be the subject of the previous clause, which is "The mechanic." Therefore, "he" refers to the mechanic.

So the correct antecedent for "he" is:

(A) The mechanic was in a good mood

Hence, the answer is (A). The pronoun "he" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the mechanic.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" refers to the entity that Sam met with, which is "the producers." Since the sentence mentions that Sam goes to the office after meeting with them, it is logical to assume that "their" refers to the producers' office, as that is where they operate or are located. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is the producers' office.

So the correct answer is:

In the given sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure suggests that someone is asking a question to another person regarding their need for assistance. The verb "asked" is in the past tense, so we are looking for the subject who could have performed the action of asking. Here, the options are "assistant" and "physician."

The sentence structure follows the pattern "Subject asked the other person if they need help." Since "he" is a masculine pronoun, it typically refers to the person who is being addressed, which in this case is the recipient of the question. Given that the physician is the one being asked if they need help, the antecedent of "he" is "the physician."

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Asked if the physician needs help

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to in the sentence. The antecedent of "she" could be either the manager or the secretary, since "the manager" is the subject of the first part of the sentence and "the secretary" is the object of the message. The verb "didn't reply" indicates an action that follows the sending of the message, and without additional context, it's unclear whether "she" refers to the sender or the recipient.

Therefore, the pronoun "she" is ambiguous, and the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the antecedent mentioned right before it. Since "the housekeeper" is the subject immediately preceding "him," the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the housekeeper.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent of "they" should be the subject of the clause that explains why the practitioner made a house call. Since "the patient" is the one who is supposed to be feeling unwell, leading to the need for a house call, the most logical antecedent for "they" is "the patient."

So, the correct interpretation is:

The practitioner made a house call for the patient because the patient felt gravely ill.

Therefore, the answer is (B). The patient felt ill.

In this sentence, "her" is the pronoun we need to clarify the antecedent for. Since there are two people mentioned, the reporter and the chef, "her" could potentially refer to either one of them. 

Option (A) suggests that "they" (reporter and chef) will discuss the reporter's favorite dishes, while Option (B) suggests that they will discuss the chef's favorite dishes. The sentence itself does not provide enough information to determine whether "her" specifically refers to the reporter or the chef.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous, as the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is unclear based on the given sentence.

The pronoun "he" in the sentence "Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter" is ambiguous. The sentence structure allows for two interpretations:

1. If "he" refers to Alex, the sentence would mean that Alex didn't know Taylor until Alex sent a letter. This interpretation aligns with option (A).
2. If "he" refers to Taylor, the sentence would mean that Alex didn't know Taylor until Taylor sent a letter. This interpretation aligns with option (B).

Without additional context, it is not clear whether "he" refers to Alex or Taylor. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "review" suggests that someone is looking at or examining something. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun, we need to find what it is modifying. The options are either "student" or "architect." 

If "her" refers to the student, the correct interpretation would be that the student is reviewing their own blueprints (option A).
If "her" refers to the architect, the correct interpretation would be that the architect is reviewing their blueprints (option B).

However, without additional context, it's not clear whether "her" is referring to the student or the architect. Therefore, the pronoun "her" is ambiguous in this sentence. So the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" refers to the antecedent that Sam is associated with. Since the sentence states that Sam went to "his" office after meeting with the producers, it implies that the office belongs to Sam, as he is the subject performing the action of going to the office. Therefore, the antecedent of "his" is Sam's office.

The correct answer is:
(B) The office was Sam's office.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the subject of the verb "told," and it refers to the person who received the communication. The sentence structure suggests that the construction worker is the one doing the action (calling) and sharing information (the whole story). Therefore, it is logical that "him" refers to the recipient of the call, which is the editor, not the construction worker. So the antecedent of "him" is the editor.

The correct answer is (B) Told the editor the story.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent for the pronoun "they." The verb "made" suggests that the action is attributed to one of the two subjects, the developer or the secretary. The reason given for the meeting is the mistake, so it's logical to assume that the person who made the mistake would be the one needing to meet with the other person to address it.

The sentence structure implies that "they" refers to the person who caused the need for the meeting, which is typically the one who made the mistake. Since the sentence does not specify whose mistake it was, the pronoun "they" could be referring to either the developer or the secretary.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous, as the antecedent is unclear without additional context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used, which can potentially refer to either the educator or the student. The verb "discuss" suggests that both parties could be involved in discussing a policy, but without additional context, we cannot definitively determine whose grading policy it is.

The pronoun "her" in the sentence "After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office" could potentially refer to either Sam or the producers, depending on the context. However, based on common usage, when someone mentions going to their "office" after an event, it is usually understood that they are referring to their own personal office.

In this case, since "Sam" is the subject of the sentence and the action of going to the office comes after the meeting with the producers, it is most likely that "her" refers to Sam. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is Sam, not the producers. So the answer is (A) It is Sam's office. However, without additional context, it could be argued that there's some ambiguity, but given typical conventions, (A) is the best choice.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to determine what it is referring to, either the nurse or the laborer. The clause "because she smelled awful" provides the reason for the action described in the first part of the sentence. Since "smelled awful" is a negative quality typically associated with someone, it's more logical that "she" would be describing the person being avoided, which in this context is the laborer, as the nurse is the one running.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the laborer. The correct answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" must refer to the person or group that received the blueprint from the designer. The antecedent of the pronoun "them" must be the noun or pronoun that the verb "gave" is connected to. Here, "gave" is connected to "them," which means the antecedent must be the direct object of the verb "gave." The sentence states that the designer collaborated with the carpenter, so it is logical to assume that "them" refers to the carpenter, as the carpenter is the other person mentioned in the context of receiving the blueprint.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second clause "was in a good mood." To clarify the antecedent, we need to look at the context provided by the first clause. The first clause is "The mechanic greets the receptionist," which suggests that the mechanic is performing an action (greeting) towards someone. Since the pronoun "she" follows this action and is typically used to refer to a person being greeted, it is most logical that "she" refers to the person being greeted, which in this case is the receptionist.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is:

(B) The receptionist was in a good mood.

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "wrote," which suggests that it is referring back to the subject that performed the action of writing. Since "the writer" is the subject immediately before the pronoun, it is clear that "they" refers to the writer. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "The writer."

So the correct answer is:
(B) The writer wrote a good book.

In the sentence, "Alex did not know Taylor until she sent a letter," the pronoun "she" is crucial to determine its antecedent. The verb "sent" is a clue to the subject of the action. Since "Taylor" is the only female pronoun-possessing noun mentioned after "until" and before "she sent," it is logical to assume that "she" refers to Taylor.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun "she" in this context is:

(B) Taylor sent the letter

So, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context is that the taxpayer is meeting with the accountant for help with tax preparation. The pronoun "she" could potentially refer to either the taxpayer or the accountant, since both are female gendered nouns. However, the verb "help" suggests an action being offered, and typically, it's the accountant who provides help with tax preparation.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "she" in this context is the accountant, as it makes more sense for the accountant to be the one offering help. So the answer is (B). The accountant could help. However, without additional context, there is a small ambiguity, but based on common practices, (B) is the best interpretation.

In this sentence, we need to identify whose idea is being referred to by the pronoun "their." The antecedent of "their" should be the subject of the clause immediately preceding it. The clause is "the designer's idea can be implemented," which suggests that the designer's idea is the one being discussed in the context of the meeting. Therefore, the antecedent of "their" is most likely the designer's idea.

So the answer is (B) The designer's idea could be implemented. The sentence implies that the reason for the developer meeting with the designer is because the designer's idea has potential for implementation.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" refers to the subject of the clause that precedes it. The clause is "the house ... was structurally sound," and "he" must be referring to the person who owns the house, since the context suggests the owner is concerned about its structural integrity.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The homeowner had purchased

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "if they need any help." To determine the antecedent, we look at the subject of the first clause, which is "the assistant" or "the physician." The assistant is asking a question, so it would make more sense for the pronoun "they" to refer to the person being asked for help, which is typically the recipient of the request.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "the physician" because the assistant is asking if the physician needs help. So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked if the physician needs help.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the clause "because," which implies that it is providing additional information about the subject of the previous clause. The previous clause is "The mechanic disliked the cashier," so the pronoun "she" must be referring to the person who is disliked. Since the cashier is the one being disliked, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the cashier.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) The cashier is arrogant.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "he." The pronoun "he" can potentially refer to either the developer or the secretary, as both are singular nouns that could be the subject of the sentence after "because." Let's analyze each option:

(A) If "he" refers to the developer, the sentence would mean that the developer met with the secretary because the developer made a mistake. This makes sense in the context, as it's common for someone to meet with someone else after making a mistake.

(B) If "he" refers to the secretary, the sentence would mean that the secretary met with the developer because the secretary made a mistake. However, this interpretation is less common, as typically a secretary wouldn't meet with a developer because of their own mistake, unless the secretary was responsible for coordinating the meeting.

Given the two possibilities, the pronoun "he" is ambiguous without additional context to clarify whether it refers to the developer or the secretary. Therefore, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" is used to refer to the subject of the previous clause, which is the person receiving the information.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining its antecedent. We have two possible antecedents: "the designer" and "the carpenter." The verb "gave" is important here. If "her" refers to "the designer," it would mean that the designer gave a blueprint to themselves, which is unlikely. On the other hand, if "her" refers to "the carpenter," it makes sense, as the designer is giving something to the person they collaborated with.

Given the context, it is more logical that "her" refers to the carpenter, as the designer is giving something to the collaborator, who is typically the recipient of the blueprint in this scenario. Therefore, the correct antecedent is "the carpenter." So the answer is (B).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "asked". To determine the antecedent of "her," we need to see who could be the one being asked to clean the room. The antecedent for "her" must be a female, as "her" is a gendered pronoun. Here, the only female mentioned in the sentence is "janitor."

So, the correct interpretation of "her" is "the janitor." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is the person being asked, which is the janitor. The answer is (B) Asked the janitor.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to determine who is the subject of the verb "completed" that corresponds to "he". The antecedent of "he" must be the subject of the previous clause. The clause "The technician told the customer" indicates that there are two people involved: the technician and the customer. 

Given that "he" comes after "the technician," it is most logical to assume that "he" refers to the technician. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the technician completed the repair.

So the answer is (A) The technician completed the repair. The pronoun "he" is unambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "likes" is the clue here. Since the pronoun "he" is in the subject position after the verb "tells," it is likely referring to the person who is doing the action of liking. The subject of the clause "tells the teacher" is "the visitor," so the most logical interpretation is that "he" refers to the visitor.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is "The visitor," making option (A) the correct choice.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to determine what "they" is referring to since it could logically refer to either the paralegal or the client. The verb "forgot" and the action "to file paperwork" suggests that someone responsible for filing is at fault. Since "file paperwork" is typically associated with the paralegal's job, it is more likely that "they" refers to the paralegal. However, the sentence also mentions that the consequence of not filing is "fired," which could apply to either the paralegal (for failing to do their job) or the client (for not having their paperwork filed).

Therefore, while the paralegal is the more likely antecedent based on the context, the sentence does not explicitly rule out the possibility that "they" refers to the client if the client was somehow held responsible for the failure to file. Due to this ambiguity, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "asked." To determine the antecedent of "they," we need to look at the context and see who would logically ask for a tool. The sentence states that the laborer handed the secretary a hammer, which implies that the action of handing over a tool is related to the request.

The reason for the action is given as "because they asked for a tool." Since the laborer is the one physically performing the action (handing over the hammer), it is more reasonable to assume that the person asking for the tool is the laborer, not the secretary, as the secretary is receiving the tool.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the laborer. The correct answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "warned" suggests that the speaker is communicating something that might affect the person being warned. Given the context, the pronoun "she" is most likely referring to the person who is being warned, which in this case is the nurse, since surgeons typically do not need the nurse to prepare for their own actions.

So, the correct antecedent for "she" is "The nurse." Therefore, the answer is (B). The nurse needed more time.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "helped" is the action, and "her" is the indirect object receiving the action. The antecedent of "her" should be the person to whom the action is directed. The sentence mentions "the analyst's office," which suggests that the person being referred to is likely the one whose office is being visited, i.e., the analyst.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the action, and the pronoun "her" indicates who was being asked to do something. The subject of the verb "called" is "the cleaner," and it is this person who is logically performing the action of asking. Therefore, the antecedent of "her" must be "the guard" because the cleaner is the one calling and asking a favor.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the guard

The sentence structure suggests that the cleaner is the one making the request, not the guard, so there is no ambiguity here.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The verb "had" is in the past tense, indicating that someone possessed or experienced cancer at some point in the past. We have two possible subjects for the pronoun "they": the physician and the baker. The verb "told" suggests that the subject is the one imparting information. 

If "they" refers to the physician, the sentence would read: "The physician told the baker that the physician had cancer." This doesn't make logical sense because the physician wouldn't typically share their own medical condition with a baker unless there was a specific reason.

If "they" refers to the baker, the sentence would read: "The physician told the baker that the baker had cancer." This makes more sense, as a physician might inform a baker about their own diagnosis.

Given the context, it's more likely that the physician is imparting information about the baker, as it's unusual for a physician to reveal their own health condition to someone unrelated without a medical reason. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that "they" refers to the baker.

Answer: (B) The baker had cancer.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the verb "called," and it needs to be determined whether it refers to the cousin or the boss. Since the cousin is the subject of the sentence and the action of calling is performed by the cousin, it is more logical that "they" refers to the person who called, which is the cousin. Therefore, the antecedent for "they" is "my cousin."

So the correct answer is:

(A) They were my cousin's boss

This means that the cousin called someone who was their boss, not necessarily the boss's boss. There is no ambiguity in this case, so the answer is not (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to identifying the antecedent. Since "they" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause, we need to look at the subject of the sentence "The engineer informed the client." The engineer is the one doing the informing, so it's logical that "they" would refer to the engineer.

Therefore, the antecedent of "they" is "the engineer." So the correct answer is:

(B) The client should make payments

However, if the intended meaning is that the engineer is informing the client about what the client needs to do, then "they" would indeed be ambiguous. But based on the sentence structure and common usage, it's more likely that the engineer is referring to their own responsibility, making option (B) the most appropriate choice. If there's additional context that suggests ambiguity, then (C) would be the correct answer.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to identify what "they" refers to, either the nurse or the laborer. The sentence states that the nurse stayed away from the laborer due to a reason. The reason given is "because they were very busy."

If "they" refers to the nurse, the sentence would read: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because the nurse was very busy." This doesn't make logical sense, as the nurse wouldn't typically stay away from another person because they are busy.

If "they" refers to the laborer, the sentence would read: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because the laborer was very busy." This makes more sense, as the nurse could stay away if the laborer is busy.

Since the sentence can logically be interpreted as either the nurse or the laborer being busy, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. Therefore, the answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" is the person who needs a lab assistant. Since the reason for applying is given as "because she needed a lab assistant," it implies that the subject who needs the assistant is the one who would be doing the needing. Given that the undergraduate is the one applying to work with the scientist, it's logical that "she" refers to the undergraduate, as they are the one seeking the position.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The undergraduate needed an assistant. The sentence does not indicate that the scientist is the one needing an assistant, although they might be the one providing the opportunity.

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second clause "was repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible." To determine the antecedent, we look at the context provided by the first part of the sentence. "The worker told the pedestrian" suggests that the speaker is communicating something about an action to the pedestrian. Since the pronoun "she" is coming after the subject "the worker," it is most logical to assume that "she" refers back to the worker, who is the one doing the action.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is the worker. The correct answer is (A) The worker was repairing. The option (B) The pedestrian was repairing is incorrect because the pedestrian is the recipient of the information, not the one performing the action. Option (C) Ambiguous is incorrect because there is no ambiguity in this case; "she" clearly refers to the worker.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the main action, and it's followed by a clause with "if" introducing a question. The subject of the second part of the sentence is "he," which must be referring to one of the two people mentioned: the assistant or the physician.

The sentence structure suggests that the assistant is asking a question to the physician, so it is logical that "he" refers to the physician, as the physician is the one being addressed and asked a question. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is the physician.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked if the physician could borrow money

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "protected" suggests an action taken by someone towards another person, so the pronoun "she" is likely referring to the subject who performed the action. Since "the writer" is the other person mentioned in the sentence, and the action of protecting aligns better with the sheriff protecting the writer, the antecedent of "she" is most likely "the writer."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The writer upholds the peace.

As we did in the previous examples, we need to determine who the pronoun "he" is referring to in this sentence. Here, "he" could potentially refer to either the chief or the counselor, as both are mentioned in the context. The sentence structure is: "The chief told the counselor that [he] took the day off," where "he" fills in the blank.

If "he" refers to the chief, the sentence would read: "The chief told the counselor that the chief took the day off."
If "he" refers to the counselor, the sentence would read: "The chief told the counselor that the counselor took the day off."

Since the sentence does not provide enough context to unambiguously determine which person is meant, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the key to determining the antecedent. The sentence structure indicates that "the secretary" performed an action, and "him" refers to the recipient of that action. Since "the analyst's office" was mentioned, it is logical to assume that the action of booking a flight would be done for the person whose office was being visited, which is the analyst.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that "him" refers to the "analyst," not the secretary. So the answer is (B) Helped the analyst book a flight.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent, which the pronoun refers to, must be determined based on the context. Since "she" typically refers to a female, the most logical antecedent would be someone who is being addressed by the technician and is a potential payer. In this case, that person is the customer. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the customer could pay with cash.

So the answer is (B) The customer could pay.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus. We need to determine who it could be referring to, given the context. The antecedents are the janitor and the child. Let's analyze:

1. If "he" refers to the janitor (X):
   - "The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise X would have to mop it all over again."
   This makes sense, as the janitor is the one responsible for mopping the floor.

2. If "he" refers to the child (Y):
   - "The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise Y would have to mop it all over again."
   This doesn't make sense, as a child typically wouldn't be the one mopping the floor.

Given the context, it is clear that "he" refers to the janitor (the person who would have to mop the floor if the child steps on it). Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the janitor. The answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" should be the subject of the clause that explains why the nurse stayed away. The clause "because she was very busy" provides that explanation. Since "she" is singular and refers to a female, the most logical antecedent for "she" in this context is the nurse, as the laborer is not typically referred to as "she". Therefore, the antecedent is the nurse, making option (A) the correct choice.

Final Answer: (A) The nurse was busy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun is replacing or referring to.

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both singular nouns that could potentially be the antecedent of the pronoun "his."

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure indicates that the hygienist is communicating advice to the patient.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after "performance," which typically refers to the person who received the feedback.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent must be the subject that the pronoun is referring to within the context of the sentence. The sentence structure is "The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because [subject] focus on code."

The antecedent of "they" must be someone who is focusing on code, which would prevent effective communication between the developer and the writer. Since the sentence starts with "the developer," it is more logical to assume that "they" refers to the developer, as it's the subject of the sentence and the one who would be directly affected by their focus on code.

Therefore, the antecedent is (A) The developer focuses on code.

Answer: (A) The developer focuses on code.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. The antecedent of "she" is the person being addressed by the verb "asked." Since the verb "asked" is directed towards the physician, it's logical to assume that the pronoun "she" is referring to the physician. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the assistant is asking the physician if _she_ (the physician) could borrow some money.

So, the answer is (B) Asked if the physician could borrow money. The ambiguity here is resolved based on the context of the sentence, which indicates that the physician is the one being asked for money.

In this sentence, we need to identify what "their" refers to since it can be either the student's or the architect's blueprints. The antecedent for "their" should be determined based on the context provided by the action of setting up a meeting to review blueprints.

The sentence suggests that the student is taking the initiative to meet with the architect, which implies that the student is likely the one seeking review or has an interest in the blueprints. Therefore, it is more reasonable to assume that "their" refers to the blueprints that the student is bringing or discussing with the architect.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) The blueprints were the architect's

However, without additional context, it could also be argued that the student is reviewing the architect's blueprints for a project they're working on together. In this case, the ambiguity would persist. If the sentence specifies that the student is reviewing the architect's work, then (B) would be the correct answer. Since there is no explicit clarification, the most appropriate response given the options is (C) Ambiguous.

In the given sentence, "The physician told the baker that she had cancer," the pronoun "she" is the key element to determine its antecedent. The antecedent of "she" must be the subject of the clause where the pronoun is used, which is "had cancer." Since "she" is a female pronoun, it is clear that it must be referring to the person who is receiving the information about having cancer. In this context, that person is the one being told, which is typically the listener in a conversation. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the baker, as the physician is the one doing the telling.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The baker had cancer

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" refers to the person who owns or has a specific office mentioned after the verb "go to."

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent of "her" must be a female person, since "her" is used as a possessive pronoun to indicate ownership. The possible antecedents are "parent" and "secretary," but since "parent" is a singular noun and typically wouldn't have a female secretary (as secretaries are usually associated with individuals), the most likely antecedent for "her" in this context is the secretary.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the secretary is being referred to as the one being called. So the answer is:

(A) They were my parent's secretary

This eliminates the possibility of "They were the secretary's secretary" because it suggests that the secretary has their own secretary, which is less likely in this context. The sentence doesn't provide enough information to determine if the secretary is specifically a female, so the pronoun "her" remains ambiguous in terms of whether it's referring to the parent or the secretary. However, based on the context, it's more reasonable to assume it's the parent's secretary.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after the verb "asked." To determine the antecedent of "her," we look at the noun that the pronoun is logically related to. The sentence is structured as follows: "The guard called [someone] and asked [her] to open the door." Here, "her" is the object of the verb "asked," and it is clear that the action of asking is directed towards the person being called, which in this case is the cleaner.

So, the correct antecedent of "her" is the person who was asked, which is the cleaner. Therefore, the answer is (B) Asked the cleaner. The sentence does not imply that the guard asked the guard, as that would create redundancy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "because he used big words." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who is using big words. The antecedent should be the person whose action of using big words is causing the communication issue described in the first part of the sentence.

The first part states that "the developer was unable to communicate with the writer," which suggests that the problem lies with one of these two individuals. The pronoun "he" is likely to refer to the subject of the first part, as the second part explains why there was difficulty in communication.

Therefore, the antecedent of "he" is most likely "the developer," since it is the developer who is trying to communicate with the writer. So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer uses big words

However, this is not correct based on the logic provided in the sentence. The correct interpretation would be that the developer uses big words, not the writer. Therefore, the answer should be:

(A) The developer uses big words

The original statement (C) Ambiguous is incorrect because the pronoun is not truly ambiguous in this context; it refers to the developer.

- If "they" refers to the manager, the sentence would mean: "The manager sent a message to the secretary, but the manager didn't reply yet."

Both interpretations are possible, making the antecedent of the pronoun ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "were in a good mood." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify which person or group could be in a good mood based on the context provided. The sentence starts with "The mechanic greets the receptionist," suggesting that there are two people involved.

The pronoun "they" can logically refer to either the mechanic or the receptionist since both are mentioned in close proximity and the action of being in a good mood can apply to either one. Therefore, without additional context, it is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent of "they" could be either the janitor or the child, depending on the intended meaning of the warning. 

If the warning is directed towards the child, the correct interpretation would be that if the child steps on the wet floor, "they" (the child) would have to mop it. In this case, the antecedent is (B) The child.

However, if the warning is meant for the janitor, who is responsible for mopping the floor, the correct interpretation would be that if the janitor has to mop it again due to the child's action, "they" (the janitor) would have to do it. In this case, the antecedent is (A) The janitor.

Since the sentence is ambiguous without additional context, the answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In the sentence "The manager asked the employee to not forget her car," the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "her" typically refers to the female noun that comes immediately before it, which in this case is "employee." Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is the employee's car.

So the correct answer is:

(B) It was the employee's car

In this sentence, "the reporter" and "the chef" are both singular nouns, and "his" is a singular possessive pronoun. The pronoun "his" could potentially refer to either the reporter or the chef, as neither is specified as the owner of the favorite dishes. Therefore, without additional context, it's ambiguous who "his" refers to.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the clause that follows it, "had purchased." The antecedent of the pronoun "she" must be the noun phrase that precedes it and is logically related to the action of purchasing. Here, "the homeowner" is the only antecedent that fits this description since it is the one asking the question about the house. Therefore, "she" refers to "the homeowner."

So the correct answer is:
(A) The homeowner had purchased

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after the conjunction "because," which suggests it is providing a reason for the action of correcting. Since "she" follows "the secretary," it is logical to assume that "she" refers to the secretary, as the secretary is the one performing the action of correcting. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is "the secretary."

So the correct answer is:

(A) The secretary understood the problem

The sentence implies that the secretary has a better understanding of the problem, which is why she is correcting the developer. There is no ambiguity here; the pronoun is unambiguously referring to the secretary.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "was fired." We need to determine what entity is most logically connected to being fired based on the information provided in the first clause. The first clause states that "the paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client," which implies that the paralegal is the one responsible for the action leading to the consequence mentioned in the second clause.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the paralegal, and the correct interpretation is that the paralegal was fired. The answer is (A). The option (B) "The client was fired" is not correct because there is no direct connection between the client and being fired in the sentence provided. Option (C) is incorrect because the antecedent is clear in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause, "should floss every day." To determine the antecedent of "they," we look at the previous part of the sentence where the pronoun could logically refer to. The hygienist is the one giving advice, so it makes sense that "they" would be referring to the patient, who is the one receiving the advice.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "they" in this context is the patient. So the answer is (B). The patient should floss.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The verb "broke" suggests an action, and "she" is the subject typically associated with breaking something. Given that "she" comes after the verb "yelled," it is most likely referring to the person who performed the action immediately preceding it. In this case, "the tailor" is the one who broke a window, as "after" implies a cause-and-effect relationship.

So the correct antecedent for "she" is "The tailor." Therefore, the answer is (B) The tailor broke a window.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to identify what "she" is referring to. The antecedent for "she" should be the subject of the verb "could not meet". The sentence is "Alex tells us that _ could not meet." Since "Alex" is the subject of the sentence and the pronoun "she" follows it, it is clear that "she" refers to Alex.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(A) Alex could not meet

So, the answer is (A). The pronoun "she" is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The verb "gave" is the main action, and "her" is the indirect object of that action. The antecedent of "her" should be the person who receives the action of giving. The possible antecedents are "the carpenter" and "the clerk". 

Since the sentence states that the carpenter made a desk for the clerk, it's reasonable to assume that the clerk is the one who would receive a discount, as it's common for a seller to give discounts to customers. Therefore, the correct interpretation of "her" in this context is:

(B) Gave the clerk a discount

So, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is unambiguous and refers to the clerk. The answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" refers to the person the construction worker is communicating with. The verb "called" indicates that the action of calling is directed towards someone, and the verb "told" follows, implying that the story is being shared with that person. Since the construction worker is the one doing the calling and telling, it is logical that "them" refers to the person on the receiving end of the call, which is the editor.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is the editor, and the correct answer is (B) Told the editor the story. The sentence does not suggest that the construction worker is telling the story to themselves, making option (A) incorrect. There is no ambiguity here, so option (C) is also incorrect.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is used to refer to a person. The antecedent of "his" should be someone who can call another person's boss. The possible antecedents for "his" are "my cousin" and "the boss." Since the sentence is about my cousin calling someone, it is most likely that "his" refers to my cousin's boss, not the boss's boss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

(A) They were my cousin's boss

So the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" is the key to understanding the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun that the pronoun is replacing. The verb "sold" is the action being performed, and "him" is the object receiving the action. Since "him" comes after "sold," it logically refers to the second person mentioned in the sentence who can be the object of the sale.

The sentence states that the salesperson is trying to deceive someone (the writer), and it is the salesperson who is performing the action of selling. Therefore, the antecedent of "him" is the person who is being sold something, which in this context is the writer, not the salesperson. 

So the correct answer is:

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

In the given sentence, "The reporter and the chef discussed their favorite dishes," the pronoun "their" is used to refer to both the reporter and the chef. Since there are two individuals involved in the discussion, it's not clear whether "their" refers specifically to the reporter's dishes or the chef's dishes. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous

In the given sentence, "The customer and the chef discuss their culinary training," the pronoun "their" is used to refer to both the customer and the chef. Since the sentence implies that both individuals are involved in the discussion, the culinary training being discussed could be both the customer's and the chef's. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is shared by both parties, making it ambiguous.

So the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to refer back to a previous subject. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for buying the car is related to the need of the person receiving the gift. Since "the accountant" is the direct object of the verb "bought," it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the person who receives the car. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "the accountant."

So the correct answer is:

(B) The accountant needed a car

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "asked" suggests that someone is making a request, and the context of helping the CEO find a book indicates that the action is related to searching for the book.

The antecedent of "she" could logically be either the librarian or the CEO, as both are female and could potentially ask for assistance. However, the sentence structure implies that the librarian is the one performing the action of helping, which is more consistent with the idea of asking for something.

Therefore, the most appropriate antecedent for "she" in this context is the librarian. So the answer is (A) The librarian asked.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either Bailey or the director. The antecedent depends on the context and whether the office is understood to belong to the person who is meeting or the person being met.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The verb "asked" is the clue that helps us identify who performed the action of asking. Since "he" appears after the verb "asked," it is most likely referring to the subject that performed the action of asking. In the context of the sentence, the two possible subjects are "the librarian" and "the CEO." The sentence structure suggests that the librarian is helping the CEO, so it is logical to assume that the reason for the librarian's help is the CEO's request. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is "the CEO."

So the answer is (B) The CEO asked.

In this sentence, the pronoun "him" refers to the person who receives the action of receiving the blueprint. The antecedent for "him" should be the person mentioned just before the pronoun. The sentence states that the designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave something to the carpenter. Therefore, "him" refers to the carpenter, as the designer is the one doing the giving.

So the correct antecedent is:

(B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint

Hence, the answer is (B). The pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to connect two actions: correcting the secretary and understanding the problem. The antecedent of "they" must be someone who can both correct and understand the problem. 

We have two possibilities:
1. If "they" refers to the developer, then the sentence would mean "The developer corrected the secretary because the developer better understood the problem" (option A).
2. If "they" refers to the secretary, then the sentence would mean "The developer corrected the secretary because the secretary better understood the problem" (which is less likely, as the developer is doing the correcting).

Given that the developer is the subject who would typically have the authority to correct someone based on their understanding of a problem, the most logical antecedent for "they" is the developer. Therefore, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure indicates that the disclosure is being made by the subject of the first clause, which is "the patient."

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the focus. We need to identify what it refers to. The antecedent of "she" must be a female noun or pronoun from the previous part of the sentence. The only potential antecedents are "the customer" and "the salesperson," both of which can be female. The sentence structure suggests that someone is asking for a favor, so it's logical to assume that the person making the request would be the one sending the prices.

Therefore, the most appropriate antecedent for "she" in this context is "the salesperson," as it's more common for a salesperson to send product prices in response to a customer's inquiry. So the answer is:

(B) The salesperson would send the prices

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. The pronoun "her" typically refers to the gender of the noun that precedes it. Since "culinary training" is a general concept and can be associated with either a customer or a chef, we cannot definitively say whether it refers to the customer or the chef without more context. However, the use of "her" suggests a female perspective, which could potentially refer to either a female customer or a female chef.

Therefore, without additional context, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

The sentence could be interpreted in either way, and it's not clear from the sentence alone which person's culinary training is being discussed.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." We need to determine who "she" refers to since there are only two potential antecedents: the patient and the specialist. The verb "had" is the key here, as it indicates possession or occurrence of a condition. Since the reason for referring the patient to the specialist is given as "a rare skin condition," it makes logical sense that "she" refers to the patient, who is the one with the condition. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the patient.

So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "her" is a possessive pronoun, it typically refers to the noun that comes immediately before it, which is "student" in this case. Therefore, "her" is most likely referring to the student's grading policy.

So the correct antecedent for "her" is the student, and thus the answer is:

(B) It was the student's grading policy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used to connect the reason for the referral. We need to determine whether "they" refers to the patient or the specialist. Since the sentence mentions that the patient was referred "because" of their expertise, it implies that the expertise is what led to the referral. Therefore, "they" is most likely referring to the patient, who is the subject of the previous clause.

So the correct antecedent for "they" is the patient. The answer is (A). The specialist is not the focus of the clause explaining the reason for the referral.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to. In this sentence, there are only two female characters mentioned: Bailey and the director. The antecedent for "her" must be one of these two. Since "Bailey" is a common name for a woman, it's less likely that "her" would refer to Bailey, as the sentence structure suggests that Bailey is planning to meet someone else. Therefore, it is more likely that "her" refers to the director.

So the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is the director. The correct answer is:

(B) It will be the director's office

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the focus. The antecedent of "her" should be the person who the writer is addressing or trying to fool. Given the context, "the salesperson" is the one who the writer is interacting with and attempting to deceive by telling a fake story. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "her" is "the salesperson."

So the answer is (B): Told the salesperson a fake story. The sentence does not imply that the writer is telling a fake story to themselves, hence the pronoun is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent for "he" must be the subject of the clause that comes before the pronoun. Here, "the engineer" is the subject that precedes "he," so the engineer is the one who would need to make the payments. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

The antecedent of "he" is "the engineer."

So the answer is (B) The client should make payments, as it refers to the client needing to make payments, which is not what the pronoun "he" indicates. The pronoun "he" correctly refers to the engineer, so the statement is not ambiguous in this context.

2. If "their" refers to "secretary," the sentence means "My parent called the secretary's secretary for more information" (option B).

Since "their" could logically refer to either the parent or the secretary, the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is used after the verb "asked." The antecedent of the pronoun "him" must be the person to whom the action is directed. Since "the cleaner" is the subject who performs the action of calling and asking, it is logical that the pronoun "him" refers to the person being asked to do something.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun "she" refers back to. Here, there are two possible antecedents: "visitor" and "teacher." The sentence structure suggests that "she" is responding to the teacher, so it's likely that "she" refers to the subject of the previous clause, which is "the teacher."

If "his" refers to the developer, the sentence would mean that the developer's idea can be implemented, which is option (A).
If "his" refers to the designer, the sentence would mean that the designer's idea can be implemented, which is option (B).

Since the sentence does not clearly specify whose idea it is, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to understanding the antecedent. The verb "needed" suggests that the subject of needing a car is the person who receives the car. Since "the accountant" is the direct recipient of the gift (a car), it is logical to assume that "they" refers to the accountant in this context. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is "The accountant."

So the correct answer is:
(B) The accountant needed a car.

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is the focus. We need to determine who "them" is referring to since there are two potential antecedents: the secretary and the analyst. The verb "helped" suggests that the action is directed towards one person, as helping is typically a singular action.

The sentence structure indicates that the secretary went to the analyst's office, which implies that the secretary is the one who is performing the action (helping). Therefore, it is logical that "them" refers to the analyst, as the secretary is the one assisting the analyst.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Helped the analyst book a flight

The antecedent of the pronoun "them" is ambiguous in the original sentence, but based on the context, it refers to the analyst.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining its antecedent. The verb "gave" indicates an action, and "her" is a possessive pronoun, which usually refers to the direct object of the verb. Since "the designer" is the only female noun mentioned before "her," the most likely antecedent for "her" is "the designer."

So the correct interpretation is that the carpenter gave something to the designer. Therefore, the answer is (B) Gave the designer a prototype. The sentence does not suggest that the carpenter received a prototype, so option (A) is incorrect. The pronoun is unambiguous in this context, so option (C) is also incorrect.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "needed more time to prepare." To determine the antecedent, we look at the previous clause, where the pronoun is introduced. The antecedent is typically the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing in the earlier part of the sentence.

Here, "he" is following "the surgeon warned the nurse," so the most logical antecedent for "he" is "the surgeon." The surgeon is the one who would need more time to prepare, as they are the ones performing the surgery.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) The surgeon needed more time

In the given sentence, "The manager asked the employee to not forget his car," the pronoun "his" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We must consider whether "his" refers to the manager or the employee.

- If "his" refers to the manager, the sentence would mean the manager asked the employee to not forget the manager's car. This makes sense if the manager owns or is responsible for the car.
- If "his" refers to the employee, the sentence would mean the manager asked the employee to not forget the employee's car. This also makes sense if the employee owns the car or if the context implies the employee has a specific responsibility for a car.

Without further context, it's ambiguous which "his" the pronoun refers to, as both interpretations are plausible. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, "My cousin called their boss for more information," the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either "my cousin" or "the boss." The verb "called" suggests that someone is making a call, and the pronoun "their" is used to indicate the person performing the action of calling. Since "their boss" is the recipient of the call, it's more logical that "their" refers to the person making the call, which would be "my cousin" in this case.

So, the correct antecedent for "their" is "my cousin," not "the boss." Therefore, the answer is:

(A) They were my cousin's boss

The option (B) "They were the boss's boss" is less likely because it implies that the boss is calling their own boss, which is not the typical situation described in the sentence. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no ambiguity in this case.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we're looking for. The sentence structure indicates that "he" is doing the action of writing a good book. Since "the writer" is the subject immediately before "he" and is the one who typically writes books, it's logical to assume that "he" refers to the writer.

So, the correct antecedent for "he" is "The writer." Therefore, the answer is (B). The writer wrote a good book.

In this sentence, "she" is the pronoun we need to clarify the antecedent for. The context suggests that "she" is doing an action (sending the letter) before another person (Alex) knows Taylor. Since the subject "she" comes after the action "sent the letter," it is more logical to assume that "she" is the one performing the action, not the recipient of the information.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent for "she" in this context is the person who sends the letter. So the correct interpretation is:

(A) Alex sent the letter

The pronoun "she" refers to Alex, making option (C) Ambiguous incorrect in this case.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they". The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing. Here, "they" could potentially refer to either the driver or the tailor, as both are capable of breaking a window. The sentence structure doesn't provide enough information to definitively determine which one is meant.

So, the answer is (C) Ambiguous, as the antecedent of "they" is unclear without additional context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The verb "understood" is a key indicator of what "he" is referring to, as it describes an action related to the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the secretary correcting the developer is that one person has a better understanding of the problem than the other.

The phrase "because he better understood the problem" implies that the person who understands the problem better is the one who possesses the knowledge that justifies the correction. Since the secretary is the one performing the action (correcting), it is logical to infer that "he" refers to the one who has the better understanding, which is typically the subject of the verb "corrected". Therefore, in this context, "he" refers to the developer.

So the correct answer is:

(B) The developer understood the problem

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is clearly referring to the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is "the janitor." The verb "asked" is in the past tense and is directly followed by "him," indicating that the action of asking was directed towards the janitor. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "him" is the janitor, and the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to either the scientist or the artist, since both are working together.

In this sentence, "her" is the pronoun we need to clarify. Since "the reporter and the chef" are both singular nouns, the antecedent could potentially be either one of them. If "her" refers to the reporter, then the discussion would be about the reporter's favorite dishes. If "her" refers to the chef, then the discussion would be about the chef's favorite dishes. Therefore, without further context, it is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the key to identifying the antecedent. We need to determine whether "they" refers to the investigator or the witness. Since the context suggests that the investigator was trying to interview the witness, it's logical that "they" would refer to the subject that was pursuing the action, which in this case is the interview.

So, "they" being too late would make more sense if it refers to the person who was trying to do something but missed their opportunity (i.e., the one who was behind schedule). That would be the investigator, as they are the one attempting to meet the witness.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The witness was too late

The pronoun "they" is ambiguous in this sentence, but based on the context, it seems to imply that the investigator was too late, not the witness.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is used after "because." To determine the antecedent of "she," we need to look at the context preceding the pronoun. The sentence structure suggests that "she" is referring to someone who likes to teach others. The part "The cook is always teaching the assistant" implies that the cook is performing the action of teaching. Therefore, the most logical antecedent for "she" is the cook, as it is the subject of the previous clause.

So the correct answer is:

(A) The cook likes to teach

The sentence does not imply that the assistant likes to teach, and there is no ambiguity regarding the antecedent of "she" in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female person, and the context suggests that the CEO bought the car for someone, it's reasonable to assume that "she" refers to the person who needed the car, which is usually the recipient of the action (buying a car). Therefore, in this case, "she" refers to the accountant.

So the correct antecedent for "she" is "The accountant needed a car."

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female subject, and the context suggests that the writer is being praised for writing a good book, it is logical that "she" refers to the writer. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is the writer. So the correct answer is:

(B) The writer wrote a good book

This means that the sentence implies that the chief encouraged the writer because the writer (not the chief) had written a good book. The pronoun "she" is clear in this context, and there is no ambiguity.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining its antecedent. We have two possible antecedents for "his": the pathologist and the victim. Since a pathologist typically uses their own microscope for examining tissue samples, it is more logical that "his" refers to the pathologist's microscope.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) It was the pathologist's microscope

So the antecedent is clear in this case, and there is no ambiguity.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that "she" refers back to. Since "she" comes right after the subject "paralegal," it is most likely that "she" refers to the paralegal, as it makes sense in the context that the paralegal's action (forgetting to file paperwork) led to a consequence (being fired).

Therefore, the correct antecedent for "she" is the paralegal. So the answer is:

(A) The paralegal was fired

The pronoun "they" in this sentence can potentially refer to either the mechanic or the receptionist, since both are mentioned in the context of standing in front of the door. The verb "greet" typically implies someone approaching or acknowledging another person, so it's reasonable to assume that the person doing the greeting is aware of the other person's position. Since the reason for the greeting is provided by "they are standing in front of the door," it's not clear whether "they" refers to the person initiating the greeting or the person being greeted.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is ambiguous. The correct answer is (C).

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "could help with tax preparation." The antecedent of "he" should be the noun that the pronoun refers to. The possible antecedents are "the taxpayer" and "the accountant."

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is used after the conjunction "because," which indicates a cause-effect relationship. The antecedent of the pronoun must be the subject that caused the action.

In this case, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since the sentence structure is "Bailey plans to meet the director at [his] office," we need to see who the pronoun "his" could logically refer to. Given that "the director" is the one mentioned just before "his office," it is most reasonable to assume that "his" refers to the director.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "his" is the director's office.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "they" is the subject of the second clause "could send the prices." The antecedent of "they" must be determined based on the context provided by the first part of the sentence, which is about the customer asking the salesperson something.

The sentence structure is: "The customer asked the salesperson if _ could send the prices."

Here, "they" is a pronoun that logically fits after "the salesperson," since the customer is asking a question to the salesperson. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that "they" refers to the salesperson, who would be the one sending the prices if the customer's request is granted.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) The salesperson would send the prices

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to refer back to a subject. We need to identify who among the two mentioned individuals, the cook or the assistant, is more likely to be the one liking to teach others. The antecedent for "he" should be someone who has the action of teaching others as a part of the sentence.

The sentence says, "The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques," which implies that the cook is actively engaged in the act of teaching. Therefore, it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the cook, as the action of teaching is attributed to the cook in the preceding part of the sentence.

So, the correct antecedent for "he" is (A) The cook likes to teach. The sentence is not ambiguous in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent must be the subject of the clause "felt gravely ill" since it is the action being attributed to someone in the context of the sentence. The two possible subjects are "the practitioner" and "the patient."

- If "he" refers to the practitioner, the sentence would read: "The practitioner made a house call for the patient because the practitioner felt gravely ill."
- If "he" refers to the patient, the sentence would read: "The practitioner made a house call for the patient because the patient felt gravely ill."

Given that the sentence does not specify whose feeling is being described, it is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

In the given sentence, the pronoun "her" is used after the verb "asked." The verb "asked" is in the past tense, and it's clear that someone is asking for feedback. Since "her" is a female pronoun, we need to identify the female noun that comes before it. In this case, there are two potential antecedents: "designer" and "cook." However, it is unlikely that the designer would ask the designer for feedback on their own work. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the pronoun "her" refers to the cook.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to in the sentence "Bailey plans to meet the director at her office." There are two possible referents for "her," which are Bailey and the director. Since the sentence structure suggests that Bailey is planning to meet someone, it is more likely that "her" refers to the person Bailey is meeting, which would be the director.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. We need to determine who "they" refers to, as there are two possible antecedents: the worker and the pedestrian. The verb "should avoid" indicates an action, and the context suggests that someone is giving advice. Since the worker is the one giving the advice, it is logical that "they" would be referring to the person giving the instruction.

So, the correct interpretation is that the advice is directed towards the pedestrian, not the worker. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the pedestrian. The answer is (B). The worker told the pedestrian that the pedestrian should avoid the closed portion of the street.

In this sentence, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun "they". Since the pronoun "they" typically refers to the subject of the previous clause, we look at the subject before the pronoun. The subject before "they" is "the technician." Therefore, it is most likely that "they" refers to the technician, as the technician is the one who is performing the action of completing the repair.

So the correct antecedent for "they" is "The technician," which corresponds to option (A). The sentence structure supports that the technician is the one completing the repair, not the customer. Therefore, the answer is (A).

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to identifying the antecedent. The antecedent of "her" should be the noun that the pronoun is referring to. Here, "Sam" is the subject of the sentence and is a singular person. The verb "went to" implies that the office belongs to the person who is performing the action, which is Sam in this case.

So the correct interpretation is that "her" refers to Sam. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is Sam, and the correct answer is (B) The office was Sam's office. The sentence does not specify if it's the producers' office or Sam's, so there is no ambiguity regarding the office ownership in this context.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, which modifies the verb "send." We need to identify who the pronoun "he" is referring to within the context of the sentence. The sentence structure is: "The customer asked the salesperson if _ could send the prices."

The antecedent of "he" must be one of the two people mentioned, the customer or the salesperson. Since the customer is asking the salesperson a question, it is more logical for the pronoun "he" to refer to the person being asked, which is the salesperson. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the salesperson would send the prices.

The antecedent of the pronoun "he" should be the subject of the previous clause that it refers to. Here, the only possible subjects are "the worker" and "the pedestrian." Since the verb "told" suggests that the speaker is communicating information, it's more likely that the person giving the instruction or explanation is the one doing the action.

Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that "he" refers to "the worker," as the worker is the one who is telling the pedestrian what they're doing. So the correct answer is:

The verb "handed" suggests an action performed by the laborer, and the reason for that action is given by "because he asked for a tool." Since "he" follows "the laborer," it is most likely that "he" refers to the laborer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) The laborer asked for a tool

The sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that the secretary asked for a tool, as there is no other context to imply a switch in the subject asking for the tool. Hence, the pronoun "he" is unambiguously referring to the laborer.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is used to connect to the subject that better understands the problem. The antecedent must be the person who possesses the understanding. Since the sentence states that the developer corrected the secretary, it implies that the developer is the one doing the correcting, which suggests they have a better understanding of the problem. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the developer.

So the correct answer is (A) The developer understood the problem. The sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that the secretary understands the problem better than the developer, so option (B) is incorrect, and the sentence is not ambiguous about the antecedent of "he," making option (C) also incorrect.

In this sentence, the pronoun "their" refers to the people mentioned before it, which are "producers." The sentence suggests that after meeting with these producers, Sam will go to a location associated with them. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "their" is the producers, and the office they own or work in would be the one Sam will go to.

So the correct answer is:

(A) It will be the producers' office

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" must refer to one of the two nouns mentioned, "nurse" or "laborer," since it's the only other person in the sentence. The verb "smelled" is a verb of perception, so it is more likely to describe the person being perceived as smelling awful. Given that the nurse is running away from the laborer, it's reasonable to infer that the reason for the action is that the laborer has an unpleasant smell. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is the laborer.

So the answer is (B). The laborer smelled awful.

In this sentence, the pronoun "his" is the key to determining the antecedent. We have two possible referents for "his": the student's or the architect's. The sentence structure suggests that someone sets up a meeting to review blueprints, and since "his" is used after "blueprints," it's logical to assume that the person who owns or is associated with the blueprints would be the one reviewing them.

Given that the architect typically creates blueprints, it's more likely that "his" refers to the architect's blueprints. Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

(B) The blueprints were the architect's.

So, the answer is (B).

In the given sentence, the pronoun "them" is used after the action of asking. To determine the antecedent of "them," we need to identify who the designer asked for feedback. The verb "showed" suggests that the designer is the one doing the action, and the context of "asking for feedback" typically implies that the person receiving the blueprint is being asked for input. Since the cook is the one who would provide feedback, the antecedent of "them" is the cook.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Asked the cook.

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to understanding the antecedent. The verb "sold" indicates an action performed by the subject, which is "the salesperson" in this case. Since "her" is a female gendered pronoun, it logically refers back to the person just mentioned before it, which is "the writer." Therefore, the antecedent of "her" is "the writer."

So the correct answer is:

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

This means that the salesperson attempted to deceive the writer and ended up selling her something of poor quality. There is no ambiguity in this sentence regarding the antecedent of the pronoun "her."

In the given sentence, the pronoun "him" is the antecedent we need to identify. The sentence structure is: "The guard called the cleaner and asked [him] to open the door." Here, "him" refers to the person being asked to perform an action, which is "open the door." Since the action follows "asked," it is logical that the pronoun "him" is referring to the person who was asked to do something. In this case, that person is the cleaner, as the guard is the one doing the asking. Therefore, the antecedent of "him" is the cleaner.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Asked the cleaner

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" could potentially refer to either the visitor or the teacher, since both are mentioned in close proximity. The verb "likes" is the key to determining the antecedent, but without additional context, we cannot definitively say who likes the cake. Therefore, the pronoun is ambiguous, and the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In the sentence "The manager asked the employee to not forget their car," the pronoun "their" could potentially refer to either the manager or the employee, as both are singular third-person nouns. The context doesn't provide enough information to definitively determine which car the pronoun refers to. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).
 94%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▉     | 235/250 [2:04:58<07:10, 28.67s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the focus of our analysis. We need to identify what "he" is referring to in the context of the sentence. The sentence structure suggests that "Alex" is doing the action of telling, and there is a pronoun "he" that follows, so it is most logical that "he" refers back to "Alex."

The sentence "Alex told us that he could not meet" means that Alex is the one who is unable to meet. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is "Alex," making option (A) the correct interpretation.

So the answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet
 94%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▏    | 236/250 [2:05:27<06:42, 28.77s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the antecedent we need to identify. The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun is replacing or referring to. Here, "her" is clearly referring to a female individual, and the context suggests that the construction worker is communicating with someone. The verb "called" and "told" imply that there's a recipient of the story.

The antecedent of "her" must be the person the construction worker is calling and telling the story to. Given that the construction worker is the subject of the first part of the sentence, it is logical that they are the one doing the action of calling and telling the story. Therefore, the story is being told to the person the construction worker is addressing, which is the editor.

So the correct answer is:

(B) Told the editor the story

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause "upholds the peace." To determine the antecedent, we need to identify who has the action of upholding the peace in the context of the sentence. The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun is replacing.

The first part of the sentence states that "the sheriff protected the writer," which implies that the sheriff is the one performing the action. Since the pronoun "he" comes after the action of protecting, it is logical to assume that "he" refers to the subject of the previous clause, which is the sheriff.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the sheriff, and the correct answer is:

(A) The sheriff upholds the peace.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "their" might be referring to. As in the previous example, there are two possible referents for "their": Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" alone doesn't provide enough information to definitively choose one over the other, as both could potentially meet at either office.

Since "their" can be interpreted as belonging to either Bailey or the director, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Ambiguous

In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since the sentence mentions "Sam" right before the pronoun, it is logical to assume that "her" refers to Sam, as Sam is the subject of the sentence and would typically use a possessive pronoun like "her" to indicate their own office. Therefore, the antecedent of "her" is Sam. 

So the correct answer is:
(B) It will be Sam's office.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" can potentially refer to either the visitor or the teacher, since both are people mentioned in the sentence. The verb "liked" is in the past tense, so it could be describing an action performed by either of these individuals. Therefore, without additional context, the antecedent of "they" is ambiguous.

So the correct answer is:
(C) Ambiguous
 96%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▉   | 241/250 [2:08:14<04:39, 31.06s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to determining the antecedent. Since "Alex" is the subject of the clause "told us," it's most logical that "she" refers to Alex. Therefore, the pronoun "she" is referring to Alex's ability to meet, not ours. So the antecedent of the pronoun "she" is Alex.

The correct answer is (A) Alex could not meet. The sentence means that Alex is the one who is unable to meet, not the group "we." Thus, the pronoun is unambiguous in this context.
 97%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▎  | 242/250 [2:08:45<04:07, 30.98s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the focus. The antecedent is the entity that "they" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that "they" is the subject of the clause "could not meet." Since "Alex" is the subject of the main clause "Alex told us," it's reasonable to assume that "they" refers to Alex, as Alex is the one doing the action of telling and potentially not being able to meet.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "they" is Alex. So the correct answer is:

(A) Alex could not meet

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context suggests that "he" must be referring to someone who is busy, as the reason given for the nurse staying away is their busyness. Since the nurse is not typically described as being busy in this context, it's more likely that "he" refers to the laborer, who is the person doing the work that requires being busy. Therefore, the correct antecedent for "he" is the laborer.

So the answer is (B). The laborer was busy.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the clause "asked for a tool." The antecedent of "she" must be the person who is asking for a tool. Given that "the secretary" is the only female noun in the sentence preceding the pronoun, and the action of asking for a tool is being attributed to "she," it is clear that "she" refers to the secretary.

So the correct antecedent is (B) The secretary asked for a tool.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the subject of the second part of the clause, which comes after the conjunction "that". To determine the antecedent of "she," we need to look at the subject of the main clause before the conjunction. The main clause is "The visitor told the teacher," so the antecedent of "she" must be the person doing the telling, which is "the visitor."

Therefore, the correct antecedent is (A) The visitor liked the cake. The pronoun "she" refers to the visitor, not the teacher, since the teacher is the recipient of the information, not the one expressing a liking for the cake. The answer is (A).
 98%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▋ | 246/250 [2:11:01<02:15, 33.76s/it]================================================================================================================================
In this sentence, the pronoun "she" is the key to identifying the antecedent. Since "she" typically refers to a female subject, we can look at the options to see if there's a female character that fits. Here, "the counselor" is the only female mentioned in the options, so the antecedent of "she" is most likely the counselor.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The counselor took the day off.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the subject of the second clause, "needed to get more rest." We need to determine whether "he" refers to the surgeon or the patient. Since the surgeon is the one warning the patient, it is logical that the warning is directed towards the patient needing rest. Therefore, the antecedent of "he" in this context is the patient. So the correct answer is:

(B) The patient needed more rest.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is the antecedent we need to identify. The context is that the technician is communicating with the customer, so "he" must be referring to one of them. Since the sentence suggests that the action of paying with cash is being discussed, it is more likely that the person who can perform this action would be the subject of the pronoun. Given that "the customer" is the one receiving the information about payment methods, it makes sense that "he" would be referring to the customer in this context.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the customer, so the correct answer is:

(B) The customer could pay

In this sentence, the pronoun "them" is used after "gave," which implies that "them" refers to the subject that received the action of giving. Since "the housekeeper" is the last noun mentioned before "them" and it makes logical sense that someone would give tips to a housekeeper, the antecedent of the pronoun "them" is most likely "the housekeeper."

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Gave the housekeeper some tips

The sentence structure suggests that "the chief" is thanking "the housekeeper" and then performing an action (giving tips) on "them," which refers to "the housekeeper." There is no ambiguity in this case, as "them" clearly refers to the housekeeper, not the chief.
