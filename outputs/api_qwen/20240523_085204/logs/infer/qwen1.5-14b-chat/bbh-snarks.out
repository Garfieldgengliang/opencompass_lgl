Option (A) describes someone as generous for promoting a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need, which is a positive action and aligns with the adjective "generous." 

Option (B) describes someone as a "terrible person" for the same action, which contradicts the positive outcome of the charity stream. It's sarcastic because using the word "terrible" to describe someone who is doing a good deed, especially one that raises a significant amount for a noble cause, is an unexpected and ironic way of expressing disapproval or disbelief.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).
  1%|▍                                                                                      | 1/178 [00:54<2:39:52, 54.19s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that the person should simply be happy to avoid depression, implying that happiness is a solution to the problem of depression. However, the statement itself doesn't directly imply sarcasm, as it could be genuinely offering advice.

Option (B) rephrases the suggestion from (A) but adds a sarcastic tone by placing "Hey just be happy" at the beginning, which gives it a more dismissive or mocking connotation. The phrase "that you won't be depressed anymore" implies that the suggestion to be happy is trivializing the complexity of the issue, suggesting that being happy is an easy fix for something that can be deeply rooted and challenging.

Based on the context, the sarcasm in Option (B) comes from the implied irony that the very thing being suggested (happiness) is not a simple solution to the problem.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
  1%|▉                                                                                      | 2/178 [01:34<2:15:21, 46.14s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider sarcasm, the statement should convey a meaning opposite to what is being said. 

In (A), the phrase "that's what keeps it okay" implies that making memes about racism is acceptable, which is not the typical view on racism. It's sarcastic because it suggests that trivializing racism through memes somehow justifies it.

In (B), the phrase "that's what keeps it toxic" implies that making memes about racism contributes to a negative environment, which is a more accurate reflection of how many people perceive using racism as a meme topic.

Therefore, the statement that is sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).
  2%|█▍                                                                                     | 3/178 [02:29<2:26:43, 50.31s/it]================================================================================================================================
The statement (A) suggests that allowing someone to get away after being assaulted is not a reasonable response, as if the speaker believes the person should have taken action against the attackers. This is likely sarcastic because in most cases, letting someone get away for assault would be considered a poor decision.

On the other hand, statement (B) directly contradicts the typical expectation that one should not let an assailant go unpunished. Saying someone is right in such a situation would be unusual, and thus, it could also be sarcastic, but it might also be interpreted as irony if the speaker is being sarcastic about how illogical the suggestion is.

Given the context, both (A) and (B) can be seen as potentially sarcastic. However, since (A) is more straightforward in expressing disbelief or disapproval, it is more likely to be the sarcastic option.

So the answer is (A).
  2%|█▉                                                                                     | 4/178 [03:22<2:28:53, 51.34s/it]================================================================================================================================
Both (A) and (B) suggest that the difference between "threatening" and "urging" or "pleading" is minimal or insignificant, with the phrases "totally different" being used ironically to convey that the distinction is not as clear-cut as the speaker implies. 

In the context of sarcasm, both statements are making light of the idea that urging or pleading is just a milder form of threatening, which is usually seen as a more serious action. However, (A) uses "threaten" twice, which could make it seem like the speaker is highlighting the absurdity of downplaying the severity of the threat, while (B) uses "pleaded," which might not carry the same level of intensity as "threatened."

Given that sarcasm often involves exaggeration for comic effect, (A) may be slightly more overtly sarcastic due to the repetition of the word "threaten." Therefore, the most likely sarcastic statement is (A).

Answer: (A)

Both (A) and (B) express surprise at using unconventional takeout containers (hardwood or plastic). However, when we consider sarcasm, the choice is likely to be the one that is unexpected or unlikely, given the typical usage of takeout containers.

Hardwood containers for takeout meals are highly unusual and impractical, so (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it is highlighting the absurdity of such an occurrence.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

If we analyze both options:

(A) Suggests that poverty is easily avoidable or that the person should simply stop being poor, which is a clear exaggeration, as overcoming poverty is generally not a simple task. This statement implies the opposite of what it says, making it sarcastic.

(B) Recommends not being rude, which is a straightforward piece of advice that doesn't inherently contain an element of sarcasm. It is a genuine suggestion that might be intended to encourage politeness.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A).

The statement (A) suggests replacing trams with carriages, which implies a return to a less efficient or outdated mode of transportation. This could be seen as a sarcastic suggestion if the speaker believes trams are a better option and is mocking the idea of going back to carriages.

On the other hand, statement (B) proposes replacing trams with lightrails, which are a type of light rail system, which is often considered a more modern and environmentally friendly alternative to trams. This statement does not seem to讽刺 the idea of upgrading transportation.

Based on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it implies a backwards step while (B) suggests a reasonable improvement.

Therefore, the answer is (A).
  4%|███▉                                                                                   | 8/178 [07:21<2:38:05, 55.80s/it]================================================================================================================================
In (A), the speaker is acknowledging the person's increased daily drinking, which is generally not considered a positive transformation. By describing it as a "great transformation," the statement is using sarcasm, as the expected response would be to praise a healthier behavior like exercising, not drinking.

In (B), the speaker is acknowledging the person's daily exercise, which is indeed a positive transformation. The phrase "what a great transformation" is in line with the expected appreciation for such a change.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
  5%|████▍                                                                                  | 9/178 [08:13<2:33:50, 54.62s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we look at (A), it states that being over six feet tall is the sole reason for someone to be considered tall, which is a straightforward observation without any implied irony or sarcasm.

On the other hand, (B) implies that being over six feet tall is a guarantee of being wonderful, which is an exaggeration and an unrealistic expectation. The word "wonderful" is not necessarily associated with height, making this statement seem like it's mocking or using humor to imply that height alone doesn't determine someone's worth or abilities.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).
  6%|████▊                                                                                 | 10/178 [09:12<2:36:51, 56.02s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) says "Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef," which implies that working in a restaurant, which could be any restaurant, has led to impressive culinary skills. This might not be entirely sarcastic, as some people can gain valuable cooking experience from restaurant work.

However, Option (B) specifies "McDonald's," which is a fast-food chain known for its standardized, quick meals rather than high-quality cuisine. Saying "Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef" would likely be considered sarcastic because it's expected that someone working at a fast-food chain wouldn't necessarily develop exceptional culinary expertise.

Based on this reasoning, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (B). So the answer is (B).
  6%|█████▎                                                                                | 11/178 [10:17<2:43:51, 58.87s/it]================================================================================================================================
If the game is indeed over after the second half, then (A) would be a factual statement, not sarcastic. However, if the statement implies that the game should logically be over after only the first half, which is unusual for a standard game format where it typically continues for two halves, then (A) could be interpreted as sarcastic, suggesting that the speaker finds the situation absurd.

On the other hand, (B) seems like a straightforward statement, assuming the game is indeed over after the first half, which is not typical but could happen under certain circumstances, like a sudden victory or an early ending due to a rule violation.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it challenges the norm, while (B) could be a genuine statement.

Answer: (A)

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that conveys the opposite meaning of what is being said, often in a humorous or mocking manner. 

Option (A) states "Yeah, anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system," which implies that anarchism is commonly presented as a model for effective governance. However, anarchism is typically associated with a lack of centralized authority, which contrasts with the concept of a governing system. Therefore, this statement might be sarcastic if it is meant to mock or criticize the idea of teaching anarchism as a model.

Option (B) says "Yeah, democracy is taught as a prime example of a governing system," which is a straightforward statement since democracy is indeed a widely recognized form of governance. There's no inherent irony or contradiction in this statement.

Given these analyses, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something with the opposite meaning or intention. In the context of gourmet sophistication, salt is a basic and common ingredient, while caviar is generally considered a luxurious and high-end food item.

Option (A) suggests that salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication, which is a statement that would likely be considered absurd or ironic, as salt is not typically associated with the pinnacle of culinary refinement.

Option (B) states that caviar is the highlight of gourmet sophistication, which aligns with the actual perception of caviar in the context of fine dining.

Given this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).

If we consider the typical experience of working in retail, pushing a trolley of returns around the store would likely be seen as a tedious or burdensome task, especially if it's referred to as "one of the worst things." Therefore, if the statement is sarcastic, it would imply that the task is actually enjoyable, which contradicts the typical perception.

Option (B) directly contradicts the expected sentiment, suggesting that pushing a trolley of returns is enjoyable, which is an unusual perspective to take seriously. This makes it more likely to be a sarcastic statement.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
  8%|███████▏                                                                              | 15/178 [14:06<2:33:48, 56.62s/it]================================================================================================================================
Sarcasm often involves saying something that is the opposite of what is expected or believed to be true, usually with a tone that implies the opposite is true. In this case, the idea being conveyed is about defeating a stronger enemy.

Option (A) suggests that the best strategy is to fight on the enemy's terms, which would typically not be considered a good approach if they are stronger and better regimented. It implies that following their strategy would be disadvantageous.

Option (B), on the other hand, advocates for fighting on one's own terms, which might be seen as a more strategic approach, especially when dealing with a superior force.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it goes against conventional wisdom about how to win a battle against a superior opponent.

So the answer is (A).
  9%|███████▋                                                                              | 16/178 [15:16<2:43:12, 60.45s/it]================================================================================================================================
When evaluating these statements for sarcasm, we need to consider the typical expectations and implications of being "great" or "terrible" relationship material. If someone is described as "great relationship material," it usually means they exhibit qualities that foster healthy, stable relationships. On the other hand, if someone is described as "terrible relationship material," it implies the opposite – they would likely cause problems or difficulties.

In the context of being "drunk," it's generally understood that alcohol consumption can negatively impact a person's judgment, communication, and behavior, making them less suitable for a healthy relationship.

Given these considerations, (B) "He's such great relationship material when he's drunk" is the unlikely scenario, as it goes against the common understanding that excessive drinking is not a positive trait for a partner. Therefore, (B) is the sarcastic statement, as it presents a situation that is illogical and contrary to what would be expected. 

Answer: (B)

If we consider the context, a sarcastic statement would imply the opposite of what is being said, especially if the situation is exaggerated for comedic effect.

(A) In this statement, the speaker expresses disappointment about their expensive phone's battery life but suggests returning it instead of simply accepting the issue. While it might be frustrating, it's a reasonable response, so it doesn't seem overly sarcastic.

(B) Here, the speaker again expresses disappointment about the phone's battery life but suggests throwing it away in the dumpster, which is an exaggerated and unrealistic response, implying that they don't expect to actually do it. This is a more likely candidate for sarcasm, as it goes beyond a typical reaction to a problem.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).
 10%|████████▋                                                                             | 18/178 [17:24<2:46:48, 62.55s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) states that the website is a "rock-solid source" despite being well-known for posting falsehoods and spreading false rumors. The term "rock-solid" is often used to describe something that is solid and reliable, which is the opposite of a source that spreads misinformation. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic because it presents an absurdity by praising a source that is known to be unreliable.

On the other hand, Option (B) calls the website a "suspicious source," which is a more straightforward and non-sarcastic way of expressing doubt about its credibility.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
 11%|█████████▏                                                                            | 19/178 [18:13<2:35:08, 58.55s/it]================================================================================================================================
In the context of the definition of sarcasm, violence is generally not considered a "perfect" way to unleash frustrations, as it is often associated with harm and negative consequences. On the other hand, exercise is typically seen as a healthier and constructive way to manage emotions.

Therefore, if we apply sarcasm, (A) would be the more ironic and sarcastic statement, as it presents violence as a desirable solution when it is not.

So, the answer is (A).
 11%|█████████▋                                                                            | 20/178 [19:05<2:28:36, 56.43s/it]================================================================================================================================
In both options, the speaker is expressing difficulty with a task involving a specific device or technology. 

(A) "Working the printer is too complex for me" - This statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is highly skilled or knowledgeable about technology and is using the simplicity of a printer as a way to downplay their own incompetence or exaggerate the complexity for comedic effect.

(B) "Working the microprocessor is too complex for me" - This statement might also be sarcastic, especially if the speaker is referring to a microprocessor, which is a highly advanced and intricate component in computing. Similar to (A), the speaker could be using the complexity of a microprocessor to express their perceived inability, but given the technical nature of the subject, it may be less likely to be perceived as sarcasm unless the context is humorous.

Comparing the two, (A) might be slightly more prone to sarcasm because printers are generally considered simpler devices than microprocessors. So the answer is:

(A) Working the printer is too complex for me
 12%|██████████▏                                                                           | 21/178 [19:52<2:20:16, 53.61s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that the world does not need more children with trust issues and psychological problems, which implies that the speaker believes the situation is already problematic. However, the phrase "no world needs" is actually a double negative, which can sometimes be used for emphasis or sarcasm, as it sounds like the speaker is suggesting the opposite - that the world does need more of these issues.

On the other hand, Option (B) directly states that the world needs more kids with these issues, which goes against the common sentiment that these problems are undesirable.

Given the context of sarcasm, where the opposite is implied, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
 12%|██████████▋                                                                           | 22/178 [20:51<2:23:30, 55.19s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider the context, Knuth's up arrow notation is a well-known mathematical concept, used to denote extremely large numbers. If someone is familiar with it, it's not unusual for them to be familiar with it. Therefore, (A) "You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?" could be interpreted as a mild surprise or disbelief, but not necessarily sarcastic.

On the other hand, (B) "You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you?" implies that using this notation should be a common or expected experience, which is unlikely to be the case, as it's not a part of everyday conversation. The use of "normal" here might suggest that the speaker finds it unusual for someone not to be familiar with it, which could be intended as a form of sarcasm.

Based on the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic.

So the answer is (B).
 13%|███████████                                                                           | 23/178 [21:44<2:21:00, 54.58s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we look at (A), the statement suggests that since it's the first week of winter, it's logical to expect the weather to get warmer in a few weeks for a playoff game. This is not a sarcastic statement because it is acknowledging the typical progression of seasons.

On the other hand, (B) states that it's the last week of winter, yet the speaker is still expecting it to get warmer in a couple of weeks for the playoff game. Given that it's the last week of winter, it would be highly unlikely for the temperature to suddenly increase. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic because it defies logic and is meant to imply that the speaker doesn't believe the claim.

So the sarcastic option is (B).
 13%|███████████▌                                                                          | 24/178 [22:59<2:35:47, 60.70s/it]================================================================================================================================
The statement (A) suggests that the act of sneaking out dangerous contraband from a government facility is difficult, which is a straightforward observation, and doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.

On the other hand, statement (B) says that sneaking out dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal, which is a direct contradiction of the expected outcome, as it implies that the act would be acceptable despite its nature, which could be seen as a sarcastic way of pointing out how absurd or illogical the situation might be.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
 14%|████████████                                                                          | 25/178 [23:59<2:34:44, 60.68s/it]================================================================================================================================
If we consider the context of the statement, sarcasm usually implies a statement that is meant to convey the opposite of its literal meaning, especially when the situation would actually be negative if the statement were true.

In (A), the statement suggests that it's fortunate that prices haven't increased significantly since eight years ago, which is generally not a good thing, especially if inflation or rising costs are a concern. Thus, if someone were to express this sentiment sarcastically, they might be pointing out how unfortunate it is that prices have remained high.

In (B), the comparison between eight days ago and now might seem less significant, as a shorter time frame could imply that a minor price increase is being downplayed. However, it still depends on the context. If the speaker is making a point about how quickly prices can rise even over a short period, they might be using sarcasm.

Given the potential for sarcasm in both options, (A) seems more likely to be sarcastic because the contrast between the apparent positivity and the underlying concern is stronger.

So, the most likely sarcastic statement is (A).
 15%|████████████▌                                                                         | 26/178 [24:55<2:30:09, 59.28s/it]================================================================================================================================
Here, the statement is sarcastic when it describes something as "endangered" that is not actually in danger, as a way to mock or express irony. In this context, "elephants" are real-life endangered species, while "trolls" are typically used metaphorically to refer to internet users who provoke conflict or argue for no productive purpose.

Option (A) refers to feeding elephants, which are genuinely endangered, so it doesn't fit the pattern of sarcasm.

Option (B) refers to feeding trolls, which is a figurative act, and describing them as "endangered" is meant to be a humorous exaggeration, suggesting that trolls are not a real threat and are more likely to thrive in online environments.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).

Based on these examples, the answer is:

(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.

If we consider sarcasm, the statement should convey the opposite meaning of what it directly says while pretending to be serious.

In (A), the speaker claims that blocking the river is a "smart move" when it implies that without the river, there's no water and electricity, which would be detrimental. Sarcasm would suggest that blocking it is actually a foolish decision, not a smart one.

In (B), the speaker calls blocking the river a "terrible move," which aligns with the expected outcome of cutting off water and electricity. Here, the statement is straightforward and not sarcastic.

Given the analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement because it presents the opposite sentiment of what is logically expected.

So the answer is (A).

Both (A) and (B) express sympathy for someone who has worked hard but received a relatively small scholarship. However, when comparing the amounts ($50,000 vs $50), the disparity is much greater in (A) than in (B). The larger amount in (A) makes the statement seem more exaggerated, which is a common technique in sarcasm.

In the context of sarcasm, if someone were genuinely surprised by a $50,000 scholarship, they might express their disbelief in a sarcastic manner by making it sound like a paltry sum. Therefore, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because of the implied irony.

The answer is (A).

Option (A) suggests that the cost of $0.15 per mile for a van is considered reasonable fuel costs. Given that most people would expect fuel costs to be significantly higher than $0.15 per mile, especially for a van, this statement appears to be making an exaggeratedly low estimate to imply that the cost is unreasonable, which is a form of sarcasm.

On the other hand, Option (B) suggests a much higher cost of $10 per mile, which might be considered reasonable by some depending on factors like the size of the van, fuel efficiency, and market conditions. This statement doesn't inherently have the same level of irony or sarcasm as (A).

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the context of the statement about leaving useless space junk in orbit, if someone were to describe the action as "brilliant," it would likely be a sarcastic remark, because leaving space debris is generally considered harmful to the environment and not a positive or intelligent act.

Therefore, (B) "So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a brilliant person" is the sarcastic option.

So the answer is (B).

Option (A) states, "I earn money for winning? Sign me up!" This implies enthusiasm and eagerness for a situation where winning results in financial gain, which is a typical positive outcome, so it does not sound sarcastic.

Option (B) says, "I lose money for winning? Sign me up!" This statement is unusual because it suggests that winning would lead to financial loss, which is generally the opposite of what one would expect. By expressing excitement to sign up for such a situation, the speaker is using irony or sarcasm, as it is not a desirable outcome.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

(A) implies that being wealthy is a necessary condition for accessing healthy food, which is not necessarily true, as healthy food can often be affordable to people from various income levels. The statement seems to exaggerate the financial barrier to healthy eating, which aligns with the definition of sarcasm.

(B) directly contradicts (A) by stating that non-rich people can also afford healthy food, which is a more realistic statement.

Given the options and the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an exaggerated claim that goes against common knowledge.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning. In this case, the word "classy" is used sarcastically when describing an action that is typically seen as unrefined or uncouth.

Option (A) says "I love it when people mock other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy," which implies that mocking others is a sophisticated or refined behavior, which is not the case. So, the sarcasm lies in the apparent praise of an action that is generally considered negative.

Option (B), on the other hand, says "I love it when people encourage other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy," which directly praises encouragement, which is a positive and expected behavior, and aligns with the common understanding of what is considered classy.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

When comparing the two statements, the key difference lies in the degree of wobbling described: "several millimeters" in (A) and "several feet" in (B). Millimeters are a very small measurement, while feet are significantly larger. If someone were to say that even a small wobble of several millimeters indicates safety concerns, it would seem to be an exaggeration or an unusual perspective, which could imply sarcasm.

In contrast, a large wobble of several feet would be much more concerning and would not typically be considered a joke or a sarcastic remark.

Given this analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it downplays the severity of a wobble to an extent that seems unrealistic for safety purposes.

So the answer is (A).

The difference between the two statements lies in the length of the wait mentioned. In (A), the wait is only two minutes, which is a very short period, and suggesting leaving over such a minor inconvenience might be considered an exaggeration or a sarcastic remark because it's unlikely someone would leave for such a short wait time. 

In (B), the wait is two hours, which is significantly longer, and it's more reasonable for someone to express frustration and consider leaving due to the extended wait time.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because the exaggeration of the inconvenience is more extreme, while (B) is a more straightforward expression of dissatisfaction.

So, the sarcastic statement is (A).

(A) The phrase "Hey genocide is clearly the most rational decision" is highly unlikely to be a sincere statement, given that genocide is widely recognized as a horrific and immoral act, not a rational one. It uses the word "clearly" to emphasize the absurdity of the claim, making it sarcastic.

(B) On the other hand, "Hey compromise is clearly the most rational decision" might be seen as a genuine statement if the context supports the idea that compromising is generally considered a rational course of action. Without additional context, it could be either sincere or sarcastic, depending on the situation.

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the inherent contradiction between the term "rational" and the act of genocide.

So, the answer is (A).

If we analyze both options:

(A) The statement "He's just kindhearted. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!" suggests that being kindhearted is a positive quality for running a country, even if it might not be the only relevant factor. The sarcasm comes from the fact that it implies that kindness alone should not determine someone's fitness to lead, but the speaker is using sarcasm to imply that it is a questionable qualification.

(B) "He's just demented. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!" directly states that someone is demented, which is a serious mental health issue, and then sarcastically suggests that it's perfectly fine for them to run the country. The statement is clearly meant to mock the idea that someone with such a condition could effectively govern.

Given these analyses, option (B) is more sarcastic. So the answer is (B).

The statement is sarcastic when it uses an expected response to express the opposite meaning. In this case, if someone were truly dedicated to earning minutes, they wouldn't be described as having 'lackluster play' and taking time out to grab hot dogs during halftime.

(A) States that the person is apathetic, which is the opposite of being dedicated, because their actions (lack of effort and eating hot dogs) don't align with the goal of earning minutes.

(B) Claims the opposite, that the person is dedicated despite their lack of performance and the unprofessional behavior.

Based on the context, (B) is sarcastic because it is saying the exact opposite of what it implies, making fun of the player's actions.

Both (A) and (B) express skepticism or disbelief about an NFL head coach with a losing record who hasn't been on the field in ten years. However, (A) uses the phrase "this is gonna go great," which is an unexpected positive outcome for a situation that usually implies a poor performance. By saying something positive where sarcasm is expected, (A) is sarcastic.

Option (A) states that protein supplements are more expensive than $1 breakfast gruel. Given that protein supplements are generally more expensive than basic food items like gruel, this statement could be true, especially if the gruel is very cheap. There's no clear sarcasm in this comparison.

Option (B) also compares protein supplements to breakfast burritos, but a breakfast burrito is a more substantial meal that might include proteins, making it a more reasonable comparison for discussing the cost of protein supplements. If the statement is meant to be sarcastic, it would imply that protein supplements are overpriced even compared to a more similar item.

Considering both options, (B) has a greater potential for sarcasm because it compares protein supplements to a more comparable food item. Therefore, the answer is:

(B) Protein supplements are way more expensive than $1 breakfast burritos.

The key to identifying sarcasm in this case is the incongruity between the statement and the expected behavior. In both options, the speaker is expressing disbelief in a 7-time felon who has just committed murder. However, the difference lies in the tone and the implied meaning.

In (A), the speaker explicitly states their disbelief but then contradicts themselves by saying they "don't believe" the murderer wouldn't lie. This is a form of sarcasm, as it implies that the speaker actually expects the felon to be truthful despite their criminal record.

In (B), the statement is straightforward and does not contain the same level of irony or contradiction, making it less likely to be sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In both options, the speaker is exaggerating the situation to express frustration or disbelief. However, the difference lies in the severity of the consequence they imply.

(A) Suggests that the speaker is annoyed by the accumulation of emails, but the consequence is merely the email count exceeding the screen size, which is not a serious issue.

(B) Takes the exaggeration a step further by suggesting that the unattended emails will become a "life-threatening issue," which is clearly an overstatement meant to convey sarcasm.

Therefore, the statement that is sarcastic is (B). So the answer is (B).

If we look at (A), the scenario described is that of a fire, which typically does not involve any threat of violence. Having weapons drawn in response to a fire call would be unusual and contrary to the usual protocol, making it seem like a sarcastic remark, as if the speaker is questioning the logic of such a response.

On the other hand, (B) describes a situation where weapons might be drawn, as shootings are dangerous events and law enforcement often arrives prepared for potential violence. It is a more plausible and expected response.

Based on the context, (A) is the more sarcastic statement, as it highlights the absurdity of drawing weapons for a non-violent situation.

Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a mocking or ironic tone. In the context of wars, it's common for wars to be fought over territory, both for conquering and for other reasons like control or resource acquisition.

If we look at (A), it claims that people never foment wars to relinquish territory, which is the opposite of what typically happens in real-life situations where wars might result from giving up land.

In contrast, (B) states that people never foment wars to conquer territory, which is also a typical motivation for wars, so this statement would not be sarcastic if taken at face value.

Given these considerations, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Both options present a sarcastic tone, as they express the opposite of what is expected. In both cases, the phrase "let's crucify" implies strong disapproval or criticism, while the act of making money is a typical and expected behavior for a nonprofit or a company.

In (A), the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the "nonprofit" and "making money," as nonprofits are generally associated with charitable work and not profiting, so the suggestion that they shouldn't be making money is sarcastic.

In (B), the same logic applies to a company, which is generally expected to make money as part of its business model. The suggestion to "crucify" the company for making money is a sarcastic critique.

So, both statements are sarcastic, but if we have to choose only one, (A) might be slightly more subtle because it refers to a nonprofit, which is less commonly associated with profit-making, making the irony stronger. However, either choice could be considered sarcastic in the given context.

Therefore, the answer is either (A) or (B). If you must pick one, I would lean towards (A) due to the subtler irony.

The statement (A) says that despite paying for Amazon Prime, which includes free shipping, the customer consistently receives delayed, damaged, non-functioning, and wrong items. The use of "So disappointed" indicates dissatisfaction, which contradicts the benefit of free shipping. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic.

On the other hand, statement (B) uses the same description of issues with Amazon packages but says "So happy," which is an unusual response to such negative experiences, especially given the problems mentioned. It is unlikely to be sincere happiness given the circumstances, so it too can be seen as sarcastic.

Option (A) suggests that America's freedom is protected by democracy, which is a political system, which might be a valid argument for some people. While it could be seen as a critique of the reliance on democracy alone for protection, it doesn't inherently carry a sarcastic tone.

Option (B) states that America is more free because they have guns, implying that armed citizens are responsible for ensuring their freedom. This statement is a clear exaggeration and possibly a dig at the idea that an emphasis on gun ownership is the primary means of protecting individual liberties, which is not generally accepted as a fact.

Option (A) states that those who make more money are inherently better, which directly contradicts the common societal critique that wealth does not determine moral superiority. This kind of statement is often used sarcastically to mock or challenge the idea that financial success equates to moral worth.

Option (B), on the other hand, says that those who make more money aren't inherently better, which is a more neutral or even agreeable statement, as it aligns with the idea that wealth does not determine a person's goodness.

The statement (A) suggests that simply eating healthy meals would not be enough to meet the demands of an active lifestyle, which implies that the speaker believes more is required. The use of "wouldn't cut it" implies a level of skepticism or disbelief that healthy meals alone are sufficient. This is a form of sarcasm because it goes against the common expectation that a healthy diet should be enough for an active lifestyle.

Option (A) states "Impossible, as there's no one on the internet." This statement is sarcastic because it implies that the idea of something being impossible is ridiculous given that there are people constantly using the internet. In reality, the internet is full of users, so suggesting that there's no one on it is meant to convey disbelief or mock the notion of something being impossible due to internet presence.

Option (B) states "Impossible, as there's no one on the Moon." While this statement might seem odd, it is not necessarily sarcastic. It could be taken at face value if the context is discussing some fictional scenario where it's assumed that there should be people on the Moon, but in reality, there isn't. However, without additional context, it's less clear whether this is a sarcastic remark.

The statement (A) suggests that if something hasn't happened before, it must not be part of the law, which is a clear exaggeration and implies that the speaker finds the idea absurd. The use of sarcasm is evident here, as the speaker is likely implying that the law should cover everything that has happened before.

On the other hand, statement (B) suggests that if something hasn't happened before, it might not be against the law, which could be a more plausible interpretation. It doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm since the speaker is acknowledging that a lack of prior occurrences might not automatically mean illegality.

In (A), the speaker is expressing dissatisfaction with the idea that funding education should not be the responsibility of the government, suggesting that it should, which is a sarcastic comment because the responsibility of providing education is generally considered to fall on the government.

In (B), the suggestion that kids should pay for school maintenance is highly unrealistic and goes against the common understanding of who should bear the financial burden of education. It is also a humorous exaggeration, making it a form of sarcasm.

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning. In this case, if we are discussing the negative effects of inner city criminals and welfare recipients, a sarcastic statement would imply the opposite.

Option (A) says "Yeah, the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to suffer." This implies that the presence of these issues is negatively impacting the speaker, which aligns with the expected meaning of sarcasm.

On the other hand, Option (B) says "Yeah, the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to thrive." This statement suggests that the presence of these issues is somehow beneficial to the speaker, which goes against the typical meaning of sarcasm when discussing problems.

In (B), the statement "diamonds are valuable" aligns with the typical understanding of diamonds as a precious gem, so it does not convey sarcasm.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the definition of sarcasm, we expect a statement that implies the opposite of what is being said while using a tone that suggests disbelief or irony. 

Option (A) states that women are "totally incapable" of pumping gas without a partner, which is a clear exaggeration and implies the opposite of what is generally expected – that women can handle everyday tasks independently.

Option (B) directly contradicts the stereotype or claim of women's incapability, stating that they are indeed capable of pumping gas without assistance.

Since sarcasm involves saying the opposite, Option (A) is the sarcastic statement.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

The statement (A) suggests that people buy insurance because of the likelihood of a riot, which is an unusual and unlikely reason for purchasing insurance, as insurance typically covers events like accidents, illnesses, or damages, not civil unrest. The use of "right" here is sarcastic because it's clear that the speaker is pointing out how absurd the idea is.

On the other hand, (B) states that people buy insurance based on the possibility of an accident, which is a reasonable and common reason for insurance. It aligns with the typical purpose of insurance.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) suggests banning breathing, which is an essential function for human survival. It is an absurd idea, and suggesting such a thing would generally be used to express disbelief or sarcasm. 
(B) suggests banning vaping, which is a less drastic suggestion than (A) as it pertains to a specific habit or activity, but it still implies that the speaker believes it's necessary, which might not necessarily indicate sarcasm.

Comparing the two options, (A) stands out as more overtly sarcastic due to its absurdity and extreme nature. 

So, the answer is (A).

The question asks for a sarcastic statement. Sarcasm usually involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning, often to mock or criticize.

In (A), the speaker is suggesting that the listener might prefer to engage with bullies who have narcissistic personality disorder, which is a negative trait. This could be sarcastic if the speaker is actually expressing disbelief or disapproval that someone would want to associate with such individuals.

In (B), the speaker is asking if the listener isn't into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder, which implies the opposite of what (A) suggests. If this were sarcastic, the speaker would be suggesting that they find it surprising that someone wouldn't be attracted to such individuals.

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a seemingly absurd preference, which is a common technique in sarcasm. Therefore, the answer is (A).

In the context of cultural appropriation, it refers to the misappropriation or exploitation of elements from one culture by members of another culture, often without proper understanding or respect for its significance. Therefore, if someone were to describe something as "cultural appropriation at its finest," they would likely be expressing dissatisfaction or irony, as it implies that the situation is not a positive example of cultural exchange but rather a negative one.

On the other hand, "It's cultural celebration at its finest!" would suggest a genuine appreciation and celebration of different cultures.

Based on this reasoning, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

In the context of the discussion about free speech and the influence of corporations, the idea that corporate money equates to free speech is often seen as a criticism, as it implies that the financial power of corporations can lead to disproportionate influence over political discourse. 

Option (A) suggests that corporate restrictions are equivalent to free speech, which directly contradicts the common understanding that restrictions are typically seen as threats to free speech. This is an ironic statement, as it presents an absurdity.

Option (B), on the other hand, explicitly states the connection between corporate money and free speech, which is a well-known concern in many discussions about the role of money in politics.

Based on this reasoning, (A) is the sarcastic statement because it takes the opposite stance of the typical critique.

So the answer is (A).

In (A), the statement implies that the graphics guy was unproductive, spending most of his time messing around instead of working, and then labels the employees as "always the laziest." This is a sarcastic comment because it presents a negative characteristic (laziness) in a humorous and exaggerated manner, suggesting that the employee's behavior is not actually lazy but rather inefficient.

In (B), the statement compliments the employees by saying they are "always the best" despite the graphics guy spending most of his time on non-work-related activities. This is not sarcastic because it directly praises the employees without irony or contradiction.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The sarcastic tone is usually used when the speaker is saying something that is the opposite of what they mean, but with a serious or exaggerated expression to imply the opposite.

In (A), the speaker is describing a situation where they haven't had enough sleep for several days, which they describe as "less than enough" and "it's been me for the past several days," suggesting they are emphasizing the negative aspect. The phrase "Isn't it just the best?" is sarcastic because it's an exaggeration of the undesirable situation.

In contrast, (B) describes having "more than enough sleep," which directly contradicts the implied sarcasm from the first part of the sentence. The sarcastic tone would not fit here, as the statement is not saying the opposite of what is meant.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

If we consider the context of a late-night vote on a bill written secretly by a single party, a democratic process would typically involve transparency, open discussion, and input from all parties. In this scenario, a statement that claims such a process is democratic would be contradictory and sarcastic.

Therefore, (B) "Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How democratic" is the sarcastic statement, as it is praising an action that goes against the principles of democracy.

The answer is (B).

If the game is meant to resemble real life, then it would logically include security cameras at the White House. Therefore, if someone were to say (B), "Of course there's several security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!" it would be a straightforward statement aligning with the expected similarity.

On the other hand, (A) "Of course there's no security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!" contradicts the expected similarity, suggesting that the game does not accurately represent reality. This kind of statement is unexpected if the goal is to emulate real life, making it potentially sarcastic because it's pointing out the absurdity of the situation.

Based on this reasoning, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) Muslims love celebrating Christmas - This statement is unlikely to be true, as Christmas is a primarily Christian holiday, and while some Muslims might appreciate the cultural aspects or engage in interfaith activities, it's not a typical celebration for them.

(B) Muslims love celebrating Eid - This statement is more likely to be true, as Eid is a significant religious festival for Muslims, marking the end of Ramadan or another important event in Islamic tradition.

Given the context of the two options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a situation that is at odds with the typical behavior of Muslims, while (B) aligns with their religious practices.

So the answer is (A).

In both options, the phrase "ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???" is a strong expression of disbelief or sarcasm, suggesting that the speaker thinks it's unreasonable to like the system being discussed.

In (A), the speaker says "Have my up vote for being rational," which contradicts the initial disbelief, as if the act of liking the system is irrational, yet they are rewarding rationality. This is a sarcastic way of saying that the act of liking the system is irrational, so the speaker would not give an upvote for it.

In (B), the speaker says "Have my down vote for being rational," which again contradicts the disbelief, but in this case, it aligns with the initial disbelief that liking the system is insane. By saying to downvote rationality, the speaker is mocking the notion that someone would be rational about liking the system.

Comparing the two, (B) is more overtly sarcastic, as it directly encourages the opposite action from what the initial disbelief suggests.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B).

Both (A) and (B) express a negative sentiment about a wave of hypothermia and drownings as a way to start the year. However, (A) suggests that it would actually be a "great" way, which is the opposite of what one would expect in a sincere statement, making it sarcastic. On the other hand, (B) directly states that it would be a "terrible" way, which aligns with the typical meaning of the phrase and is not sarcastic.

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, often in a humorous or critical way. In the context of this question, the statement about "taking out and smelling the trash" being a favorite or least-favorite activity is crucial.

If the statement is sarcastic, it would imply that the speaker actually dislikes doing that task, but is saying the opposite for some reason, like humor or irony.

Option (A) states "One of my least-favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash," which directly expresses a negative sentiment about the activity, making it seem less sarcastic.

On the other hand, Option (B) says "One of my favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash," which is an unusual expression of enjoyment, suggesting that the speaker might be using sarcasm to convey their actual aversion to the task.

Given the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic.

Option (A) suggests that being rude and demanding will result in getting "tons of trashy stuff," which implies that the speaker is mocking or making fun of such behavior because it would lead to poor quality or undesirable outcomes.

Option (B) also suggests being rude and demanding but states that it will result in "tons of free stuff," which contradicts the common understanding that such behavior would generally not lead to receiving gifts or benefits without giving something in return. However, it's less clear if the statement is sarcastic or if the speaker is suggesting that it might work in some unexpected way.

Given the context, (A) seems more sarcastic because it directly contradicts the idea that negative behavior will lead to something valuable or desirable, while (B) could be seen as sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek but is less clear.

Therefore, the most likely sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Option (A) argues that calling people names for not agreeing with you is not a good strategy to win them over, which is a reasonable point, especially when discussing politics.

Option (B) directly contradicts this logic by suggesting that calling people 'morons' is an effective way to persuade them, which is obviously absurd and goes against common sense.

Option (A) says, "Wow, you only applied to 200 internships this past week?" If taken at face value, it might seem like the speaker is impressed or surprised by the quantity of applications. However, considering the context of applying to internships, 200 is an unusually high number, and the use of "Wow" in sarcasm would imply that the speaker is actually astonished or mocking the person for applying to so many.

Option (B) says, "Wow, you only applied to 2 internships this past week?" This statement, on its own, could be interpreted as surprise or encouragement if the speaker genuinely thinks two applications are a good number. However, without additional context, it's less clear if sarcasm is intended.

Given the difference in the scale between the two statements, it is more likely that (A) is sarcastic, as it implies that the large number of applications is not a desirable or impressive accomplishment.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

(A) States that armed revolutionaries haven't had a significant impact on middle-class Americans, which is a common sentiment, as revolutions usually imply significant disruptions and changes. If the statement were sincere, it would be unusual for revolutionaries to claim to have made little change for the middle class.

(B) Directly contradicts (A) by suggesting that armed revolutionaries have indeed made a lot of change for middle-class Americans. This is unlikely to be meant sincerely, as revolutions typically don't benefit the middle class in a positive way, especially if they involve violence.

Given the context of sarcasm, where a statement may be intended to express the opposite meaning, (B) is the sarcastic option. So the answer is (B).

If we consider the typical experience of college life, where students often face stress due to assignments, grades, and exams, statement (A) describes the situation accurately as "stressful," which aligns with the common perception.

On the other hand, statement (B) describes the same experiences as "fun semester," which is an unusual way to describe a situation that is generally associated with stress rather than enjoyment.

Given the context and the definition of sarcasm, the statement that is sarcastic would be the one that contradicts reality or presents a situation in an unexpected way to express the opposite meaning. In this case, (B) is sarcastic because it is presenting a situation that is typically stressful as if it were enjoyable.

On the other hand, (B) "don't forget there are people in suffering" could be interpreted as a sarcastic remark if the context implies that someone is dismissing or trivializing the existence of those who are suffering. It might be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that the listener is being insensitive or unaware of the plight of others.

Based on the options provided and without further context, (B) might be more likely to be sarcastic if the speaker is using it to express irony or criticism. Therefore, the answer is (B), but it's important to note that sarcasm heavily relies on context, and without additional information, this assessment is speculative.

In (B), the statement says "God, to think of how bad it could have been," which implies that having someone prepared would actually be terrible, which is the opposite of what (A) suggests. By using the word "God" as a hyperbolic expression, it suggests a sarcastic tone, as if to mock the idea that a well-prepared leader would be undesirable.

If we consider the historical context, Buddhism and Christianity have never coexisted in the same region without significant conflict, particularly in regions like ancient China where Buddhism was dominant. Therefore, the statement that the Christian church had a "lock" in Buddhist China would be highly unlikely and would likely be an exaggeration or a joke.

On the other hand, the phrase "had such a struggle" is more plausible, as it aligns with the historical reality of religious tensions between the two faiths.

Given this analysis, the statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it implies an absurd level of control or influence for the Christian church in a predominantly Buddhist context, which is highly unlikely.

The question asks for a sarcastic statement, which implies that the speaker is actually expressing the opposite sentiment in a humorous or critical manner.

In (A), the speaker is asking how government control of the internet could be bad, but given the nature of the topic (usually associated with concerns about privacy, freedom of speech, and potential censorship), the actual sentiment might be that government control over the internet would indeed be detrimental.

In (B), the speaker is asking how government control of the internet could be beneficial, which is directly contradictory to the typical concerns surrounding internet governance.

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that has the opposite meaning, usually meant to mock or express disbelief.

Option (A) states, "You didn't realize that bikes are a stationary object?" Bikes are not stationary objects by nature; they are designed for movement. Thus, suggesting that someone thinks bikes are stationary would be contrary to common knowledge, making it a potentially sarcastic statement.

Option (B), on the other hand, says, "You didn't realize that bikes aren't a stationary object?" This directly contradicts the incorrect assumption that bikes are stationary, which implies that the speaker assumes the listener does know better.

In the context of pay-to-win (P2W) gated content, where users must pay to gain access or advantages, the statement is generally seen as negative, as it excludes those who cannot afford to pay and may make the experience less enjoyable for everyone. 

Option (A) claims that pay-to-win gated content is "much more fun and accessible to everyone," which directly contradicts the common understanding of P2W systems. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic.

On the other hand, Option (B) states that P2W gated content is "much less fun and accessible to everyone," which aligns with the typical perception of such practices, but it doesn't necessarily have the same level of sarcasm as (A).

So the answer is (A).

Option (A) implies that the speaker is nostalgic about the past, suggesting that they miss the simpler times when people didn't have many luxuries. However, the statement itself is sarcastic because it's not a genuine expression of admiration for the past; rather, it's a pointed critique of the present, implying that people today are too focused on material wealth and don't appreciate the lack of excess.

Option (B) seems to express concern or nostalgia about the lack of housing in the past, which doesn't fit the pattern of sarcasm, as it's a more straightforward complaint about a basic need.

Given the context, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The statement (A) suggests that it's absurd to believe that any government would ever ban something that fosters innovation, as if such a move goes against the very nature of governments' role in promoting progress. The irony lies in the fact that, in reality, governments might indeed implement regulations or bans to protect public health, safety, or other interests, which could inadvertently impact innovation.

On the other hand, statement (B) refers to inventors, who are typically the ones creating innovations. It implies that inventors would never themselves ban something that kills innovation, which seems less likely to be sarcastic because inventors might indeed advocate for their own creations or ideas to be protected.

Based on this analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to its unexpected claim about governments, which is often the opposite of what one might expect.

So the answer is (A).

The given statement is a duplicate of itself, which makes it difficult to determine sarcasm based on the provided information alone. However, if we consider the content, both options (A) and (B) suggest that entering politics is as simple as being outrageous, which is a clear exaggeration and implies the opposite – that getting into politics is not easy and requires more than just being provocative.

Given the context and the intention to highlight the challenge or irony in entering politics, the statement can be interpreted as sarcastic. Therefore, both (A) and (B) are potentially sarcastic, but since there is no distinction between them, we can only choose one.

Answer: Both (A) and (B) can be considered sarcastic, as they convey a sense of irony by suggesting that entering politics is effortless when it is, in fact, not. However, without a second choice that is not sarcastic, we can only pick one. If we must select, we might choose (A) because it is slightly more distinct from its duplicate. So, we'll go with (A).

In both options, the speaker is acknowledging that the team did significant damage and someone else completed the final blow. In (A), the term "Amazing display of team skill" is used sarcastically because if the team did most of the damage, it would be expected for the final blow to come from a team member, not an "amazing display of team skill."

In (B), the phrase "Amazing display of individual skill" is also sarcastic, as it implies that a single person's action was the impressive part, despite the team doing most of the work. It is unusual to call the final blow "individual skill" when the team has already done most of the heavy lifting.

So, both (A) and (B) are sarcastic statements. However, if we must choose only one, (B) might be slightly more sarcastic because it emphasizes the individual over the team, even though the team's overall performance is acknowledged.

Answer: (B)

In both statements, the speaker is expressing a situation where they expect little income while attending college, which implies they would benefit from tax breaks. However, the difference lies in the tone.

In (A), the statement is sarcastic because it sarcastically implies that removing tax breaks for students would actually be helpful, knowing that it would make their situation worse.

In (B), the statement is not sarcastic as it straightforwardly suggests that adding tax breaks for students would be helpful, which aligns with the speaker's expectation.

So, the sarcastic statement is (A).

The statement is sarcastic when it conveys the opposite meaning of what it directly says while using a tone that implies disbelief or irony.

(A) suggests that the speaker believes the listener wouldn't be happier if they didn't help others, which is the opposite of what the phrase "we never did anything for anyone ever" implies.

(B) suggests that the listener would be lonelier if they never helped others, which aligns with the idea that helping others fosters connections and reduces loneliness. 

Given the context, (A) is sarcastic because it's suggesting the opposite of what the literal statement is saying, making it seem like the speaker doubts the listener's happiness would actually decrease if they stopped helping.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the context of basketball, a wide open pass at halfcourt typically means a great opportunity for a teammate to score without much defense involved. In such a situation, the "obvious choice" would indeed be to pass, not shoot, as shooting from halfcourt is generally less efficient and less likely to result in a successful score.

Option (B) contradicts this common understanding, suggesting that passing when there's an open shot is not the obvious choice, which implies that the speaker is suggesting something contrary to what is expected, possibly in a humorous or mocking way.

So, the sarcastic option is (B). Therefore, the answer is (B).

In both options, the speaker is discussing a hypothetical stock purchase and sale scenario. In (A), the stock was bought at $10.50 and sold at $100, which is a significant profit. A sarcastic comment might highlight the absurdity or incredulity of such a large profit. In (B), the stock was bought at an extremely high price ($1050) and then sold at $100, which would result in a massive loss, not a profit. 

Given that the speaker is making a comment about profits, and the scenario in (B) involves a loss, it is highly unlikely for a sarcastic statement to be praising such a situation. Therefore, the sarcastic statement is likely (A), as it implies disbelief or skepticism about the profitability, despite the large profit figure.

So, the answer is (A).

The context here is about a soccer game where a player might be in a position to receive a red card for a violation. The phrase "shouldn't be a red" implies that the speaker believes the situation doesn't warrant a red card.

In (A), the statement "But his eyes were on the ball" is unusual because typically, a player receiving a red card wouldn't have their eyes focused on the ball. It's an unlikely scenario, which could be interpreted as a sarcastic remark suggesting that the player's focus was inappropriate or a distraction.

In (B), the statement "But his cleats were on the ball" doesn't seem to be as sarcastic, as it's a literal description of a player's action, although it's still somewhat odd given the context.

Given the analysis, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).

If we consider the typical connotations of the words, concrete and stained-glass, we know that concrete is usually associated with plainness, functionality, and not aesthetics, while stained glass is known for its beauty and intricate designs. 

In (A), the phrase "Concrete plates. Very beautiful" is likely sarcastic because it directly contradicts the common perception of concrete as being beautiful.

In (B), "Stained-glass plates. Very beautiful" aligns with the actual beauty commonly associated with stained glass, so this statement would not be sarcastic.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

In the given scenario, the speaker is stating that their laptop stopped working after being submerged in water, and they attribute the failure to either Asus (in option A) or themselves (in option B).

Option A suggests that the laptop's manufacturer, Asus, is responsible for the malfunction despite the user's action of submerging it in water. This implies that the user believes Asus should have made their product impervious to water damage, which is an unreasonable expectation and implies sarcasm.

Option B, on the other hand, accepts responsibility for the laptop's failure by acknowledging that it was the user's mistake to bring it underwater, which is a reasonable assumption and does not contain a sarcastic tone.

Based on the analysis, option A is the sarcastic statement. So the answer is (A).

In both options, the phrase "I for one am shocked" is used to express disbelief, but the context changes the tone.

(A) If they're losing to a team with a terrible record, it's expected that they might lose, so saying "I for one am shocked" here would be sarcastic because the defeat is not surprising given the opponent's poor performance.

(B) On the other hand, if they're losing to a team with a winning record, it would indeed be unexpected, so the statement "I for one am shocked" would likely be sincere rather than sarcastic.

Based on this analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement. So the answer is (A).

In this case, we are comparing someone to Hitler, who is widely recognized as a brutal dictator and a symbol of evil. Comparing someone to Hitler is often used to express disdain, criticism, or sarcasm, as it implies negative qualities.

Option (A) states, "Just like Hitler. A True warrior." The term "True warrior" is likely being used sarcastically here, given the historical context of Hitler's actions and the fact that he is not typically associated with noble or heroic warrior qualities.

Option (B) states, "Just like Hitler. A True demagogue." A "demagogue" is someone who appeals to the emotions of the people, especially for their own personal gain, often using manipulation and propaganda. This comparison to Hitler, who was a skilled demagogue, is also likely meant to be sarcastic.

Based on the context and the implications of each statement, both (A) and (B) are likely to be sarcastic. However, if we have to choose only one, (A) might be slightly more direct in its sarcasm, as it explicitly refers to a "True warrior," which is an oxymoron given Hitler's historical reputation.

So, the answer is either (A) or (B), but if we must pick one, I would lean towards (A) as the more overtly sarcastic statement.

In (A), the speaker suggests that if someone doesn't want high-risk investments, they should invest in Bitcoin, which is known for its volatile nature and high risk. This statement is sarcastic because it is suggesting the opposite of what the person would logically choose if they were risk-averse.

In (B), the speaker suggests that if someone doesn't want low-risk investments, they should still put it all on Bitcoin, but it's less clear whether the statement is sarcastic or not. It could be taken as a genuine suggestion, especially if the listener is unaware of Bitcoin's risk profile. However, if we consider sarcasm, the statement would imply that Bitcoin is an illogical choice for low-risk investments, which it isn't.

Given the context of the question asking for sarcasm, the more sarcastic option would be (A). So the answer is (A).

When discussing vaccines, both science and evolution play significant roles. Vaccines are developed based on scientific principles and discoveries, while their effectiveness is grounded in the theory of evolution, as they are designed to stimulate immunity by mimicking or containing weakened or dead pathogens.

Option (A) "SCIENCE CAUSES VACCINES!" could be interpreted as a straightforward statement acknowledging the role of science in vaccine creation. However, the use of all capital letters might suggest emphasis or sarcasm, making it seem like the speaker is emphasizing how obvious or expected it is.

Option (B) "EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!" also directly points out the connection between evolution and vaccines, without any overt sarcasm or emphasis on the capitalization.

Given the context, it's more likely that (A) might be intended to be sarcastic, as it could imply that the idea of science causing vaccines is so self-evident that it needs to be shouted, even though it's not necessarily a surprising statement.

Therefore, the most likely sarcastic statement is (A).

In the context of a healthy democracy, a civil war with a large death toll would obviously be a negative event. Therefore, if a statement suggests that such a situation is essential for a healthy democracy, it is not a realistic or positive view. Option (A) directly contradicts the idea of a healthy democracy and implies that suffering is necessary, which is highly unlikely to be said sincerely.

On the other hand, Option (B) states that a civil war with at least 500,000 deaths is detrimental to a healthy democracy, which aligns with the common understanding that a peaceful and functioning society is better off without such catastrophic events.

Given the definition of sarcasm, which involves saying the opposite of what one means, (A) is the sarcastic statement as it implies the exact opposite of what a healthy democracy requires.

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something with the intention of conveying the opposite meaning or mocking a situation. In this case:

(A) "That violent oppressive dictator didn't think that people would get mad at him? How pragmatic" - The phrase "How pragmatic" implies that the dictator's lack of concern for public anger is seen as a reasonable or practical approach, which is unlikely to be the intended meaning if the dictator is indeed oppressive and violent. Therefore, the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the actual behavior being described and the label of "pragmatic."

(B) "That violent oppressive dictator didn't think that people would get mad at him? How naive" - Here, "How naive" suggests that the dictator's assumption is foolish or ill-informed, which aligns with the idea that someone in such a position should be aware of the consequences of their actions. This statement seems to mock the dictator's naivety, which is a more fitting description of the situation.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, usually to mock or ridicule. In this case:

(A) "We all know diamonds are valuable" - This statement directly asserts the well-known fact that diamonds are highly prized and expensive. There is no apparent irony or contradiction here, so it is not sarcastic.

(B) "We all know diamonds are worthless" - This statement directly contradicts the commonly held belief that diamonds are valuable. By saying diamonds are worthless, the speaker is suggesting that their value is greatly exaggerated or non-existent, which is the opposite of the typical perception. This implies sarcasm since the speaker is mocking the idea of diamonds being highly valuable.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something with the intention of conveying the opposite meaning, usually to mock or criticize. 

In the given options:
(A) "Psshh, everyone knows women can't earn profit" - The use of "psshh" suggests disbelief or dismissiveness, and the claim that women "can't earn profit" is a statement that goes against the reality where women are capable of earning profits in various fields. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic.

(B) "Psshh, everyone knows women can earn profit" - If this statement were to be sarcastic, it would imply that the speaker thinks it's obvious that women cannot earn profits, which contradicts the common understanding that women can. However, without any clear context to suggest sarcasm, this statement might just sound like a dismissive remark, but not necessarily sarcastic.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that is intended to be understood as the opposite of what is being said, often to mock or express disbelief.

In (A), the statement "Everyone knows that ignorance of the law excuses nobody from following the law" suggests that no matter how much one may not know about the law, they still have a responsibility to abide by it. This aligns with the common understanding of the law.

On the other hand, in (B), the statement "Everyone knows ignorance of the law excuses you from following the law" directly contradicts the general understanding that ignorance does not excuse one from breaking the law. This would be an unusual and unexpected claim, making it more likely to be a sarcastic remark.

If we consider sarcasm, it involves saying something that is intended to be ironic or mocking, often with a tone that contradicts the literal meaning.

In (A), the phrase "so you're still independent" implies that treating a friend with benefits (FWB) as an object rather than a person is the key to maintaining independence, which is not a healthy or ethical approach. This statement is critical of such behavior, which might be interpreted as sarcastic.

In (B), the statement "not to see your fwb as a liability" suggests that seeing a FWB relationship as a potential burden or problem would hinder independence, while framing it as a way to stay independent implies the opposite – that seeing them as a means to an end is beneficial. While it might not be ideal, it doesn't necessarily carry the same level of irony or sarcasm as (A).

Based on the analysis, the statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to its underlying criticism.

Both options (A) and (B) express disbelief or disdain at the idea of people protesting or rioting against a major corporation. The use of "audacity" in both sentences implies that the speaker finds it unreasonable or inappropriate.

However, when considering sarcasm, the choice might be influenced by the connotation of "riot." A riot typically carries a stronger negative connotation than a protest, involving violence and lawlessness. In this context, (B) might be seen as more sarcastic because it uses the word "riot," which could imply that the speaker thinks such actions are even more absurd than simply protesting.

Therefore, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (B). So the answer is (B).

In both options, the speaker is discussing whistleblowers, who typically expose wrongdoing or unethical behavior. If they are accusing someone, it implies a conflict of interest.

(A) says "Back them up" when a whistleblower accuses someone, which is a seemingly supportive response, but considering the context, it is sarcastic because it asks for backing for an action that would likely put the accuser at odds with the speaker.

(B) says "Lock them up," which is an extreme and clearly negative reaction, suggesting that if a whistleblower accuses someone, the speaker wants to silence or punish them, which is an opposite sentiment to supporting them.

On the other hand, in (B), the statement suggests that his word is highly valued, as it uses "so much" in a positive context. This directly contradicts the fact that he lied, making it seem like a sarcastic way of pointing out the inconsistency.

If we consider the context of the statement, a country that has a history of frequent government changes might suggest dissatisfaction with their leaders. In that case, the statement suggesting that assuming they don't like their government is a reasonable assumption would be counterintuitive, as it goes against the common understanding based on the historical pattern.

Therefore, if the statement were sarcastic, it would imply the opposite – that assuming they like their governments despite their constant changes is more reasonable. This matches the tone of sarcasm, where the speaker is making a comment that directly contradicts common sense or expectations.

So, the sarcastic option is (B).

The question asks for a sarcastic statement. In both options, the speaker is contrasting Netflix with paying more to Comcast for On Demand service. 

Option (A) implies that using Netflix, which typically has a lower price, is a better choice than paying more for Comcast's service, suggesting that paying more is counterintuitive or unnecessary.

Option (B) suggests that using Netflix, despite its lower cost, would be a bad choice because it's better to pay more. This statement goes against the common logic of wanting to save money, which would imply that the speaker is making a point that is not meant to be taken seriously.

When considering sarcasm, the statement often contains a clear contrast or contradiction with what is expected to be true.

In (A), the speaker is questioning the idea that something is not an addiction just because it's legal, which is a common belief that illegal activities are more likely to be addictive. By suggesting that legality makes it not an addiction, the speaker is using sarcasm to imply that legality doesn't absolve something from being an issue or a problem.

In (B), the speaker is also questioning a common expectation, which is that something being legal would not make it suspicious. This implies that there's an expectation that legal actions or behaviors should be inherently trustworthy, and the sarcasm lies in pointing out how that logic might be flawed.

Both options have a similar structure, with the implied meaning being the opposite of the literal statement. However, (A) specifically targets the idea of addiction, which is a more universally recognized concern, making the contrast more apparent.

Based on this analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic.

So the answer is (A).

(A) The statement implies that a small, independent company would naturally have terrible support, which is a common stereotype or exaggeration. It is likely meant to be ironic, as larger companies usually have more resources for customer support.

(B) In contrast, the statement refers to a "megaconglomerate" having terrible support, which is unusual to associate with a large company. Megaconglomerates are typically known for their extensive resources and better infrastructure, so suggesting they have poor support is unlikely to be meant sincerely.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A), as it uses an ironic comparison to imply that a tiny indie company would have bad support, while the reality is often the opposite for such companies.

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, usually with a tone of disbelief or irony. 

(A) "Yeah war is tragic" implies that the speaker acknowledges the negative aspects of war, which is a generally accepted sentiment, so it doesn't inherently carry a sarcastic tone.

(B) "Yeah war is pacifying" is the more likely sarcastic statement because war is typically associated with violence, destruction, and unrest, not peace or tranquility. By saying that war is pacifying, the speaker is suggesting something that goes against common knowledge, which could be a sarcastic way of pointing out how absurd or contradictory the idea is.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B).

The statement (A) suggests that the assumption of being male on the internet until proven otherwise is considered unfair or discriminatory (sexist). The word "super sexist" implies that this is a negative trait, which is the opposite of what a typical positive experience would be, making it sarcastic.

On the other hand, (B) describes the same situation as "super fun," which implies that the anonymity of the internet where people are assumed to be male until proven otherwise is a delightful aspect. This contradicts the reality of the issue and, as such, could also be interpreted as sarcastic if it's meant to highlight the absurdity of the gender assumption.

Given the options and the context, both (A) and (B) can be considered sarcastic, but for different reasons. If the question asks for the more sarcastic one, (A) might be considered more so because it directly critiques the social norm, while (B) might be seen as a subtle or ironic take on the issue.

However, without further context, I'll choose the more obvious sarcastic option:

A: Isn't it super sexist that on the internet everyone is male until proven otherwise?

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Oh, great, another meeting. Just what I needed today.
(B) Oh, great, another meeting. Exactly what I needed today.

A: In both options, the speaker expresses dissatisfaction with having another meeting, but there's a subtle difference in tone.

In (A), the speaker uses "Oh, great" sarcastically, followed by "another meeting," emphasizing their frustration. The phrase "Just what I needed today" is a clear indication that the speaker does not actually want another meeting.

In (B), the repetition of "Oh, great" and the addition of "Exactly what I needed today" amplifies the sarcasm. By using "exactly," the speaker is implying that the meeting is the last thing they want or need, which is the opposite of what the phrase "great" suggests.

Therefore, the statement that is more sarcastic is:

(B) Oh, great, another meeting. Exactly what I needed today.

Based on these analyses, the final answers are:

- (A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
- (B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal - Sarcasm
- (A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics? - Sarcasm
- (A) Isn't it super sexist that on the internet everyone is male until proven otherwise? - Sarcasm
- (B) Oh, great, another meeting. Exactly what I needed today. - Sarcasm

Both options present a similar structure, with the phrase "you don't seek validation" followed by a contrasting descriptor. However, (A) uses "sociopaths" as the descriptor, which is a term often used pejoratively to describe people with certain personality traits, implying that seeking validation from them would be undesirable. On the other hand, (B) uses "users" as a more neutral term.

Given that sarcasm often involves using language that implies the opposite of what is being said in a humorous or critical manner, the use of "sociopaths" in (A) is likely intended to be ironic or sarcastic because seeking validation from a group of people who are generally viewed negatively would not be a typical or desirable behavior.

Therefore, the statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic.

Based on the analysis, the answer is (A).

(A) The phrase "obviously monolithic services are the best solution for everyone" is sarcastic because it uses the word "obviously," implying that it is self-evident, when in reality, monolithic services (large, tightly integrated systems) are generally not considered the best solution for scalability or flexibility, especially in large-scale environments like web services. The use of "webscale" here is a subtle jab at the idea that monolithic services would be ideal in such contexts.

(B) On the other hand, "Obviously microservices are the best solution for everyone" could be a sincere statement if one genuinely believes that microservices (small, independent components) are universally suitable. However, without further context, it might also be sarcastic if the speaker is mocking the idea that there's a single "best solution" for all situations, as there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to software architecture.

Given the context and the emphasis on the "obviousness" in (A), the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The logic behind the relationship between people moving out and prices going up or down is typically that if more people are leaving a location, it could lead to a decrease in demand, which might cause prices to go down. However, if the statement were to be sarcastic, it would imply that the opposite is happening.

In (A), the statement "Everybody is moving out, that's why the prices keep going up" directly contradicts the expected outcome, suggesting that the speaker finds the situation illogical or absurd, which aligns with the definition of sarcasm.

In (B), the statement "Everybody is moving out, that's why the prices keep going down" follows a logical reasoning, as it presents a plausible explanation for price decreases.

Based on the analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement. So the answer is (A).

Option (A) suggests that an increase in dollars directly leads to more people becoming rich, which is not necessarily true. While more money might create more opportunities, wealth distribution is influenced by many factors beyond just the quantity of currency. The statement implies a naivety or oversimplification, which could indicate sarcasm.

Option (B) suggests that more dollars would lead to more people getting loans, which is a reasonable assumption as more money in circulation could potentially stimulate lending activity. There's no inherent irony or sarcasm in this statement.

Based on this analysis, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) States that when small businesses struggle, the government would help by increasing its spending, which is generally seen as a supportive measure for businesses. This does not sound sarcastic, as it presents a positive response to the hypothetical situation.

(B) States that when small businesses struggle, the government would help by increasing taxes, which is the opposite of a supportive measure, as higher taxes can burden businesses further. This is a counterintuitive response, suggesting that the government might actually harm struggling businesses, which could be interpreted as sarcastic.

Option (A) presents a statement that directly contradicts common ethical values and societal norms, as denying someone a chance at a loving family based on their skin color is widely recognized as unjust and morally wrong. If the statement was sincere, it would be an absurdity.

On the other hand, Option (B) expresses the exact opposite sentiment - that it is unreasonable to deny someone a loving family based on their skin color. This aligns with the normative view that such discrimination is unjust and absurd.

Since sarcasm involves saying something that implies the opposite, (B) is the sarcastic statement, as it says something that is clearly intended to criticize or mock the idea that such discrimination could be acceptable.

Answer: (B)

The American Dream typically refers to the idea that anyone, regardless of their background, can achieve success through hard work and determination. However, Walmart is often associated with low-paying jobs and not being a stepping stone for upward mobility in many people's minds. 

Option (A) implies that despite working at Walmart, one can still achieve the American Dream, which might be seen as a tongue-in-cheek comment, suggesting that the path to the American Dream might be challenging or unlikely if one starts at Walmart.

Option (B) suggests that working at Walmart is itself a way to achieve the American Dream, which is less likely to be intended as sarcastic, as it aligns with the traditional understanding of the dream.

Based on the context, (A) is more likely to be the sarcastic statement, so the answer is (A).

When comparing the two options:

(A) "So impressive winning cups in a league with 2 teams" - If a team wins cups in a league with only two teams, it implies that the competition is quite low, and winning may not be as impressive as it would be in a larger league with more teams. This statement seems to be suggesting that the accomplishment is not particularly noteworthy, which could be seen as sarcastic.

(B) "So impressive winning cups in a league with 60 teams" - In contrast, a league with 60 teams implies a higher level of competition, and winning cups in such a league would generally be considered more impressive. This statement is not sarcastic, as it would likely be taken at face value as a compliment.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something with the intention to convey the opposite meaning. In the context of supporting a dictator, who are generally considered villains, a sarcastic statement would express the opposite of admiration or support.

In (A), the phrase "What could possibly be attractive" implies that supporting a dictator is not an attractive quality, which aligns with the typical view of dictators.

In (B), the phrase "What could possibly be wrong" suggests that there is nothing negative about supporting a dictator, which directly contradicts the common perception that supporting a dictator is morally reprehensible.

Since (B) is the statement that seems to be questioning the very notion of supporting a dictator, it is more likely to be sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B).

(A) The statement "When driving, it's very helpful to keep your foot in one place you know" is not sarcastic. It directly suggests that maintaining control over the foot on the accelerator or brake is a good practice while driving.

(B) On the other hand, "When driving, it's very difficult to keep your foot in one place you know" is sarcastic. By saying it's difficult when it's actually a crucial skill for safe driving, the speaker is implying that it should be easy but is pointing out how challenging it can be, which is a common sarcastic way to express an obvious truth.

Based on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (B). So the answer is (B).

If we analyze both options:

(A) "conspiracy theory, sounds suspicious" - The term "conspiracy theory" typically carries a negative connotation, as it implies that an idea is unlikely to be true or credible. Describing it as "suspicious" further emphasizes disbelief or skepticism, which aligns with the typical perception of a conspiracy theory. Therefore, this statement can be interpreted as sarcastic, as it's suggesting that a conspiracy theory is inherently mistrusted.

(B) "conspiracy theory, sounds legit" - In contrast, describing a conspiracy theory as "sounds legit" would imply that the idea is believable or has some merit, which is not the usual association with conspiracy theories. This statement is likely not sarcastic because it doesn't convey a sense of disbelief or skepticism.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A).

If the statement is sarcastic, it would mean that the speaker is actually expressing the opposite of what they say. In this case, if they say their friend is "very pleased" to be associated with something considered "trash," it would imply that they are actually mocking or expressing disdain.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement would be (B). So the answer is (B).

In (A), the speaker is using sarcasm because they are questioning the "absurd claim" of history repeating itself if people ignore it. By describing it as absurd, the speaker is actually suggesting that the idea is not credible, which is the opposite of what a "thoughtful" or "insightful" claim would be.

On the other hand, in (B), the speaker is praising the claim as "insightful," which implies that they find it to be a well-thought-out observation. This directly contradicts the sarcastic tone of (A).

Option (A) suggests that something is impossible in reality, specifically referring to software never malfunctioning. This statement is highly unlikely to be true, as software malfunctions are a common occurrence. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is making a point about the unrealistic nature of the assumption, which would make it sarcastic.

On the other hand, Option (B) states that something cannot happen in reality where software often malfunctions. This statement is a direct observation of the common reality, and thus, it is less likely to be sarcastic.

Given the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

(A) States that the injuries and poor offensive line play were responsible for some issue or situation. This seems like a straightforward acknowledgment of the factors contributing to the problem.

(B) States that the injuries and lack of consistent offensive line play had nothing to do with the issue. This directly contradicts common sense, as it is highly unlikely that such factors would not impact the performance.

In a sarcastic statement, the speaker would be expressing the opposite of what they believe or are saying. Given this, (B) is the sarcastic option because it is denying a fact that most people would consider to be true.

Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a seemingly sincere tone to mock or belittle. 

In (A), the statement implies that something done in a private setting would always be held against you in a professional matter, which is a hyperbolic and exaggerated claim that goes against common sense, suggesting that privacy is not a factor in professional matters.

In (B), the statement suggests the opposite, that something done in a private setting could never be held against you in a professional matter, which directly contradicts the reality where personal actions can potentially impact one's professional life.

Given that sarcasm usually involves a contradiction, (A) is the more sarcastic option as it implies the opposite of what is typically expected, making it seem like the speaker believes that privacy has no bearing on professional consequences, which is unlikely to be true.

So the answer is (A).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that implies the opposite of its literal meaning, often to mock or criticize. 

In (A), the statement suggests that the lack of reply for two years justifies the person's reaction, which would imply that expecting a response after such a long time was unreasonable. Given the context, if he didn't get a reply in two years, it is unlikely to be understandable, making the statement seem sarcastic.

On the other hand, (B) states that the reaction is understandable because he didn't receive a reply in two minutes, which implies that a quick response time should be expected, and the lack of one would be unusual. This statement doesn't imply the opposite of what it says, so it is not sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

Both options (A) and (B) present the same statement, with the only difference being the addition of "you don't think" before the statement in (B). Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant, or using a tone that belies the literal meaning of the words.

In this case, both options express disbelief in the possibility of floating ancient boats across the Pacific Ocean and invading the Inland Northwest with Soviet-era MIGs. The sarcastic nature lies in the extreme incredulity expressed in the statement, as it is highly unlikely for such an event to occur.

Therefore, since both options convey the same sarcastic tone, either (A) or (B) can be considered sarcastic. However, adding "you don't think" in (B) emphasizes the sarcasm by directly addressing someone and suggesting they would believe such a scenario, which makes (B) slightly more overtly sarcastic.

So the answer is (B).

The key to identifying sarcasm in these options is the context of the phrases. In both cases, the speaker is discussing a quality (self-centeredness or generosity) that involves putting one's own desires first, without regard for others' feelings.

In (A), the description of self-centeredness directly questions why someone should care about others' feelings when they are focused on their own wants, which implies that self-centeredness is exactly what it describes – a lack of concern for others.

In (B), the description of generosity is contrasted with the same action (not caring about others' feelings), but the word "generosity" implies a positive trait, which would typically involve caring for others. By describing it in the same negative light as self-centeredness, the sentence becomes sarcastic because it's pointing out the irony of using the term "generosity" to describe such behavior.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B). The answer is (B).

If we consider the context of stifling free speech and political opinions, (A) implies that the speaker is familiar with such occurrences, suggesting that they believe it's not an unusual situation, which could be sarcastic if the speaker is actually referring to a negative or oppressive regime.

On the other hand, (B) suggests that the speaker has never encountered such a situation, which would seem to be a genuine statement if the context is one where such suppression is not common or expected.

Based on the typical association between sarcasm and pointing out the obvious or expressing disbelief in a false claim, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the nature of history, it often involves complex events and multiple perspectives, making it unlikely to be purely black and white. Therefore, if someone were to say that history is "usually" black and white, they would be contradicting the typical understanding of historical complexity.

So, (B) is a statement that goes against the general understanding and could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic, as it is suggesting something that is generally not accepted.

On the other hand, (A) acknowledges that history is rarely black and white, which aligns with the common understanding of its complexity. It doesn't necessarily sound sarcastic.

Given the context, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Both (A) and (B) present a similar scenario where the speaker claims to be a serious fan who prefers a quiet environment for better concentration during the performance. The use of "dead silent" and "extra good attention" implies that the speaker wants a perfect atmosphere for their enjoyment, which is a typical expectation from a serious fan.

However, the context of "symphony" and "hockey" is different, with symphony concerts generally being more formal and expected to have a quiet audience, while hockey games can be loud and energetic. The sarcasm would come from the contrast between the speaker's claim of being a serious fan and the implied desire for a situation that is at odds with the typical experience of each event.

Since (A) specifically mentions "serious symphony fan," it's more likely that the speaker is using sarcasm because they are making light of the idea that someone would want complete silence during a symphony, which is not a typical expectation.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).

If we consider the context of being a lawmaker, it is generally expected that showing up for work every day is a basic responsibility. However, sarcasm often involves making a point that is the opposite of what is being said in a humorous or critical manner.

Option (A) implies that simply showing up every day is enough to be a great lawmaker, which might be an exaggeration or a critique of the assumption that being present is the sole determinant of effectiveness.

Option (B) adds the word "alone" which could be interpreted as suggesting that just showing up isn't enough, and that there must be more to being a great lawmaker than mere attendance. It might be seen as less sarcastic than (A) because it doesn't directly contradict the expectation that showing up is necessary.

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it implies that attending work daily is the only quality needed to be a great lawmaker, which is an exaggerated claim that invites sarcasm.

Option (A) suggests that the speaker finds it unlikely to trust a brief, unverified post from an anonymous internet user over a more credible source, which is a logical position to take. It implies that the speaker is being sarcastic when thanking the stranger, as they are actually expressing skepticism.

On the other hand, Option (B) directly contradicts the typical skepticism associated with trusting strangers online, stating that they would trust the three-word post without sources over solid advice. This statement does not seem to be sarcastic, as it is an unexpected endorsement of the unreliable source.

If we consider the statement to be sarcastic, it should convey a meaning opposite to what is directly said.

In (A), the statement "Impossible!! There are no girls on the internet!" implies that the speaker finds it highly unlikely that there would be no girls online, especially given the vastness of the internet and its user base. This statement seems to be sarcastic because it goes against common knowledge and is meant to express disbelief or mock the idea that there are no girls on the internet.

In (B), the statement "Impossible!! There are many girls on the internet!" suggests that the speaker believes the opposite – that it's highly likely there are numerous girls online, which aligns with the reality of the situation.

When considering sarcasm, we need to look for statements that imply the opposite of what is being said directly. In this case, the phrase "fresh-faced" typically refers to someone appearing youthful or innocent, especially when used to describe someone who is young.

(A) "You forget, he was just a fresh-faced 40 year old" - This statement is sarcastic because it is unusual to describe a 40-year-old as "fresh-faced," as that implies youthfulness, which is not typical for someone in their forties.

(B) "You forget, he was just a fresh-faced 18 year old" - This statement is more straightforward and does not imply the opposite of what is said. It describes a 18-year-old as having a youthful appearance, which is consistent with the term "fresh-faced."

Based on this analysis, statement (A) is sarcastic.

In the context of sarcasm, (A) "If it's on Britannica it must be True" implies that Britannica, a well-respected encyclopedia, would never publish false information. Thus, if something is found there, it is assumed to be accurate. This statement might be sarcastic because it takes something as authoritative (Britannica) and uses it to highlight the irony that people might not always trust reliable sources.

On the other hand, (B) "If it's on Reddit it must be True" suggests that information found on Reddit, which is known for its diverse user base and varying levels of credibility, is automatically trustworthy. This is often not the case, as Reddit can host misinformation or discussions without strict fact-checking.

Given that sarcasm usually involves a contrast between what is said and what is meant, (B) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it undermines the credibility of a platform where misinformation is common.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
 80%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▎                | 143/178 [2:02:23<27:22, 46.93s/it]================================================================================================================================
The phrase "a series of tubes" is a reference to then-US Senator Al Franken's famous question to then-Commerce Secretary nominee John D. Ashcroft during a Senate hearing in 2001, asking if he believed the internet was more like a "series of tubes" or a "series of interconnected nodes." Ashcroft famously replied that it was a "collection of individual networks," which many people found to be a simplification or an inadequate understanding of the internet's complexity.

Option (B) "That's how the internet works, it's a series of tubes" directly references this moment, using the term "tubes" in a way that implies a lack of sophistication or an exaggerated view of the internet's infrastructure. Given the context and the humor associated with the phrase, this statement can be interpreted as sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (B).

Option (A) says, "Oh no the cleats with the new spikes didn't solve the problem?" This statement implies that the speaker expected the new spikes on the cleats to solve the problem but is expressing surprise or disappointment that they didn't. The sarcastic tone comes from the fact that it sounds like a rhetorical question, suggesting that the speaker already knows the answer, which is likely that the spikes were not the magical solution they hoped for.

Option (B) says, "Oh no the cleats with the new spikes didn't solve every problem?" This statement is more straightforward and acknowledges that the new spikes might not have solved all issues related to the cleats. It does not necessarily carry the same level of sarcasm as (A), as it doesn't imply that the speaker thinks the spikes were a waste or a joke.

Given the analysis, (A) is the more sarcastic statement. So the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something that conveys the opposite meaning of what is actually meant, often with a tone that implies the opposite is true. 

In this case, if the statement is about soggy fries covered in bacon grease, which is typically considered an indulgence or a less-than-healthy food choice, the sarcastic statement would be one that implies the positive or desirable aspects despite the unhealthiness.

Option (A) directly describes soggy fries covered in bacon grease as "unhealthy," which aligns with the actual perception of the food item. Therefore, it is not sarcastic.

Option (B), on the other hand, contradicts the common perception by describing the same food as "delicious." This is a typical example of sarcasm because it implies the exact opposite of what is expected based on the health implications.

So, the sarcastic statement is (B).
 82%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▋               | 146/178 [2:04:59<26:39, 49.97s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that the real tragedy is not the act of purchasing something fraudulent, which is unexpected given that a fraud would typically be considered a negative situation. Instead, it implies that the more significant issue is someone being fooled into the transaction, which can be read as a sarcastic comment because the speaker is emphasizing the absurdity of considering such a situation a tragedy.

On the other hand, Option (B) states that the real tragedy is someone buying a Mustang, which is a well-known and desirable car model. This statement is not inherently sarcastic because it could be a genuine concern if, for example, the buyer was unable to afford it or was unaware of its limitations.

Based on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).
 83%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▏              | 147/178 [2:06:25<31:23, 60.74s/it]================================================================================================================================
(A) Suggests that the speaker assumes the listener is inexperienced or forgetful enough to need a reminder for something as basic as printing a legal-sized piece of paper, which is a common task that most people should know how to do. This implies sarcasm, as if the speaker finds the request absurd.

(B) Simply asks for a reminder on how to print a blank piece of paper, which might seem like a straightforward request, but without context, it could be taken as a genuine inquiry from someone who needs assistance.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, so the answer is (A).
 83%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▋              | 148/178 [2:07:27<30:33, 61.12s/it]================================================================================================================================
Sarcasm usually involves saying something that is meant to be taken as the opposite of what is being said, often with a tone indicating disbelief or humor. In this case, we're looking for a statement that implies that having a small number of economists supporting an economic policy is actually a good thing.

Option (A) states "But only 10,000 economists said it will help the economy," which might initially sound like a large number, but when considering sarcasm, it could imply that a large consensus is needed, and 10,000 is not enough. This could be interpreted as sarcastic if the speaker is suggesting that a smaller number would be better.

Option (B) says "But only 2 economists said it will help the economy," which, on its face, seems even more extreme than (A), as it implies a minuscule consensus. However, without any additional context or tone, it might not be clear if the speaker is being sarcastic or genuinely expressing surprise at such a low number.

Given the options, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it implies that a larger number of economists is expected for a policy to be effective, even though the number provided is already quite substantial.

So the answer is (A).

(A) "How dare you use violence!!!" - This statement is sarcastic because using violence is generally considered to be a negative action, and the exclamation points and the phrase "how dare you" imply that the speaker is surprised and disapproving, even though they are encouraging the use of violence.

(B) "How dare you use logic!!!” - In this case, the use of logic is typically seen as a positive and rational approach, so saying "how dare you" in this context would be contradictory and unusual. While it might be an unexpected response, it's less clear if it's intended to be sarcastic without more context. However, when taken at face value, it's less likely to be sarcastic than (A).

Given the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic. So the answer is (A).
 84%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▋             | 150/178 [2:09:27<28:08, 60.32s/it]================================================================================================================================
Sarcasm usually involves saying something that has the opposite intended meaning or expressing a negative opinion in a seemingly positive way. 

In (A), the phrase "good idea" is used to describe the act of "stopping" something that is implied to be undesirable, which is putting people in compartments to protect one's viewpoint. This is a sarcastic comment because it's suggesting that the opposite action (not putting people in compartments) would actually be a good idea.

On the other hand, in (B), the same phrase "good idea" is used to describe the act of "keeping" people in compartments, which aligns with the speaker's apparent perspective, making it less likely to be sarcastic.

Based on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is (A). So the answer is (A).
 85%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████             | 151/178 [2:10:27<27:06, 60.25s/it]================================================================================================================================
When evaluating these options, we need to consider the tone and implications of each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant in a mocking or critical manner.

In (A), the phrase "wonderful" is used to describe a "baseless accusation," which is typically considered negative. Using "wonderful" to describe something negative implies that the speaker finds the accusation to be anything but wonderful, suggesting sarcasm.

In (B), "striking" suggests that the accusation is particularly noteworthy or impressive, which might seem like an unusual choice to describe a baseless one. However, without further context, it could also be interpreted as genuine praise if the speaker is emphasizing the absurdity of the claim. It's not as clear-cut as (A) in terms of sarcasm.

Given the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the incongruity between the positive term "wonderful" and the negative subject of a "baseless accusation."

So the answer is (A).
 85%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▌            | 152/178 [2:11:27<26:10, 60.42s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that not engaging in manual labor like spinning clothes, mining, and forging is beneficial, implying that modern society has progressed positively because of the division of labor and specialized production.

Option (B), on the other hand, suggests that not doing these tasks ourselves is detrimental, implying that these activities are essential for personal well-being and that modern society is worse off for not relying on individual efforts.

Given that sarcasm usually involves saying the opposite of what is meant, option (B) is the sarcastic choice, as it presents a negative view on something that is generally seen as a benefit of technological advancements and specialization.

So, the answer is (B).
 86%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████            | 153/178 [2:12:32<25:38, 61.54s/it]================================================================================================================================
The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite of what is intended, often used to mock or criticize. 

In (A), the statement suggests that a single failed test from six years ago is not enough evidence to conclude that someone cheated in a recent event, which implies that there might be room for doubt or a lack of credibility in the accusation. This could be seen as a sarcastic way of pointing out how weak the evidence is.

In (B), the statement describes the same past failure as "devastating proof," which implies that a single incident from six years ago should conclusively prove guilt. This is an exaggerated and unlikely claim, which might suggest disbelief or skepticism, but it doesn't necessarily mean the opposite of what is being said, as the speaker seems to be emphasizing the absurdity of relying on such evidence.

Based on the analysis, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it is suggesting that the evidence is insufficient, which is the opposite of what would be expected if the speaker genuinely believed the failure was strong proof.

Answer: (A)
 87%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▌           | 154/178 [2:13:34<24:46, 61.95s/it]================================================================================================================================
Option (A) suggests that there are other Batman themes aside from the one the speaker is referring to, which might imply that the person is dismissing or downplaying the significance of a particular Batman score. This could be seen as a sarcastic remark if the speaker is actually emphasizing the uniqueness or exclusivity of that score.

On the other hand, Option (B) claims that the Batman score is the only one, which directly contradicts the idea of multiple themes. If the speaker truly believed this, they would not be making a sarcastic comment.

Given the context, (B) seems more straightforward, while (A) has the potential for sarcasm due to the contrast it creates. Therefore, the sarcastic statement is likely (A).

Answer: (A)
 87%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████           | 155/178 [2:14:24<22:15, 58.08s/it]================================================================================================================================
Both options (A) and (B) express a situation where someone is close to achieving a goal (1000 points in this case), but the scale at which they're expressing difficulty or ease might indicate sarcasm.

In (A), saying "I'm just 800 points from 1k, this is easy" implies that being 200 points short of the goal should be effortless, which is highly unlikely considering the magnitude of the remaining points.

In (B), saying "I'm just 8 points from 1k, this is easy" could also be sarcastic if the person is frustrated or finds the remaining distance to be unexpectedly challenging, despite being closer to the goal than in (A).

However, without further context, (B) might not seem as sarcastic as (A) since it could be a genuine statement for someone who is very close to the milestone.

Given the potential for sarcasm in both cases, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the larger point difference. So the answer is (A).
 88%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▍          | 156/178 [2:15:25<21:41, 59.15s/it]================================================================================================================================
When discussing sample sizes in statistics, a dozen people are indeed a very small number compared to the entire population of the United States. Therefore, suggesting that a dozen people can represent 320 million people is illogical and absurd.

Option (A) directly states that a small sample size is representative, which is not the typical stance one would take when discussing the limitations of small samples. It is an exaggerated and unreasonable claim, which aligns with the definition of sarcasm.

Option (B) is also pointing out the same issue, but it does so by stating the opposite – that it's a "terrible" sample size. While it agrees with the common understanding, it does not carry the same level of sarcasm as (A) since it's a straightforward criticism.

Hence, the sarcastic statement is (A). So the answer is (A).

The statement (A) says, "Better not buy any technology ever because in a few years something better will be released!!" It implies that constantly waiting for better technology is unwise and suggests that one should never make a purchase. This could be seen as a sarcastic remark, as it is unrealistic and exaggerated, suggesting that people should never buy anything.

On the other hand, (B) says, "Better not buy any exorbitant technology ever because in a few years something better will be released!!" This statement is also suggesting that it's not wise to spend on expensive technology, but it adds the qualifier "exorbitant," which narrows down the suggestion and implies that the concern is more about financial prudence than just waiting for new releases. While this might still carry a hint of sarcasm, it's less overt than (A).

Given the options, (A) is more clearly sarcastic due to its exaggerated and unrealistic nature.

Answer: (A)

The term "bigot" typically carries a negative connotation, referring to someone who displays prejudice or intolerance towards others based on their race, beliefs, etc. If someone is showing up and getting nosy, it implies they are being intrusive or bothersome, which might be an undesirable situation.

In (A), the speaker expresses enjoyment when bigots are present and engaging in nosy behavior, which is unlikely to be the speaker's genuine sentiment, especially if they are against bigotry.

On the other hand, (B) suggests that the speaker loves it when bigots get "roasted," which implies that they are being publicly criticized or exposed for their views, which could be seen as a positive outcome from their perspective, especially if the speaker is anti-bigotry.

Given the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as the speaker is expressing the opposite of what they would actually like to see happen.

So the answer is (A).

If we consider the definition of sarcasm, it involves saying something with the opposite intended meaning. 

In (A), the statement "Nice try, but everyone knows there are no women active on the internet" implies that the speaker believes women are not present online, which is a sweeping generalization and likely untrue. The phrase "nice try" is often used sarcastically when someone is being facetious or mocking a claim.

On the other hand, (B) "Nice try, but everyone knows there are many women active on the internet" directly contradicts the common stereotype that women are not active online, which is a more accurate statement and does not have the same sarcastic tone.

Based on this analysis, (A) is the sarcastic statement.

So the answer is (A).

The definition of sarcasm involves saying something that means the opposite or is intended to mock or criticize, usually in a humorous way.

In (A), the statement says "I'm spoiled by my instant access to entertainment and information." The speaker is expressing gratitude or appreciation for the ease of access, which would not be sarcastic.

In contrast, (B) says "I'm oppressed by my instant access to entertainment and information." This statement implies that having easy access to these things is a burden or a negative experience, which is the opposite of being grateful for it. It could be interpreted as sarcasm if the speaker actually finds it overwhelming or feels negatively about the constant availability.

Based on the analysis, (B) is the more likely sarcastic option.

Therefore, the answer is (B).
 90%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▉        | 161/178 [2:20:48<18:23, 64.90s/it]================================================================================================================================
(A) Suggests that having massive watermarks on videos improves the viewer's experience, which is the opposite of what would be expected, as watermarks typically detract from the visual quality.

(B) States that having massive watermarks over videos worsens the experience, which aligns with common understanding, as watermarks are generally seen as a negative aspect for video viewing.

Based on the definition of sarcasm, where a statement says the opposite of its intended meaning, (A) is the sarcastic option.
