To calculate the estimated yearly yield, we need to determine the annual revenue and then compare it to the initial investment.

Annual revenue:
- $245 per hour
- 2 hours a day
- 365 days a year (assuming you work every day)

Annual revenue = $245/hour * 2 hours/day * 365 days/year

Now let's do the math:

Annual revenue = $245 * 2 * 365
Annual revenue = $156,500

Now we subtract the daily costs to find the net daily income:

Net daily income = Annual revenue - Daily costs
Net daily income = $156,500 - $50
Net daily income = $156,000

Finally, we divide the net daily income by the initial investment to find the annual yield expressed as a percentage:

Yield % = (Net daily income / Initial investment) * 365 days/year

Yield % = ($156,000 / $98,000) * 365
Yield % ≈ 1.605 * 365
Yield % ≈ 587.3%

The answer given is not among the choices, so there might be an error in the calculation or the provided options. However, based on the math done here, the closest option would be:

B. 1.64%

This is because the actual yield is higher than 164%, but since the options don't include that, B seems to be the closest reasonable choice based on the calculation.

The NPV (Net Present Value) of an investment project is calculated by discounting future cash flows back to their present value using the discount rate. In this case, we have two cash inflows of $500 each in years 5 and 10. Assuming the discount rate is applied annually, we need to calculate:

Year 5: $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 ≈ $27.18
Year 10: $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 ≈ $16.38

Now, sum the discounted values and subtract the initial investment:

NPV = ($27.18 + $16.38) - $500 = $43.56 - $500 = -\$27.44

Since the result is negative, it means the NPV is less than zero, which indicates the project is not economically viable given the discount rate of 10%. The closest option is -\$27, so the answer is B.

The old building is being actively marketed for sale and expected to be completed within four months, which indicates it meets the criteria for being classified as an asset held for sale, not a current asset. It will be reclassified, no longer be depreciated (as depreciation relates to use over time, not sale), and still be valued at its historical cost until the sale is finalized.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.

The direct labor rate variance is calculated by multiplying the difference between the actual rate (paid wage per hour) and the standard rate (standard wage per hour) by the actual number of direct labor hours worked.

Actual rate = $21 per hour
Standard rate = $20 per hour
Actual hours per unit = 2.5 hours

Rate variance per unit = Actual rate - Standard rate = $21 - $20 = $1 per hour

Total rate variance = Rate variance per unit * Actual units produced = $1 * 9,000 units = $9,000

Since the variance is unfavorable (the company paid more than the standard), we multiply by 10,000 (planned production) instead of 9,000 to find the total variance:

Total rate variance = $9,000 * 10,000 = $90,000

Therefore, the company's direct labor rate variance for March is $90,000, but the answer options do not have that value. The closest option is D, which might be a typo or a misstated value. Given the context, the correct answer should be $90,000, but since D is the only choice, the best approximation would be D ($40,500), which is likely a fraction or percentage of the correct amount. However, without further context, it's unclear why the other choices don't match the exact $90,000.

To calculate the increase in government expenditures needed to achieve full employment, we can use the Keynesian cross formula:

Actual GDP = Autonomous Consumption + Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) * Government Expenditures

At full employment, Actual GDP equals Full Employment GDP. So, we have:

$1.2 trillion = Autonomous Consumption + 0.8 * Government Expenditures

First, let's find the autonomous consumption, which is the portion of GDP that is consumed regardless of changes in government spending:

Autonomous Consumption = Full Employment GDP - Government Expenditures
Autonomous Consumption = $1.3 trillion - Government Expenditures

Now, substitute this into the first equation:

$1.2 trillion = $1.3 trillion - Government Expenditures + 0.8 * Government Expenditures

Simplify the equation:

Government Expenditures = $1.2 trillion - $1.3 trillion + 0.8 * $1.2 trillion
Government Expenditures = -$100 billion + $0.96 trillion
Government Expenditures = $40 billion

However, the question asks for the increase needed to reach full employment, so we subtract the current actual government expenditures:

Increase = Full Employment GDP - Actual GDP
Increase = $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion
Increase = $100 billion

The correct answer is:

A. $100 billion

To determine the number of units Spark Co. must sell to achieve a 10% profit, we can set up a simple profit formula:

Profit = (Selling Price - Cost Price - Commission) * Number of Units

Let's plug in the given values:
Profit = ($200 - $125 - $25) * Number of Units
Profit = ($50) * Number of Units

Spark wants a 10% profit, which is equal to 0.10 times their total sales. We can write it as:
0.10 * ($200 * Number of Units) = $50 * Number of Units

Now, let's solve for the number of units:

0.10 * $200 = $50
$20 = $50

Divide both sides by $50 to find the number of units:
Number of Units = $20 / $50
Number of Units = 4

So, Spark must sell 400 units to achieve a 10% profit.

To calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) using the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method, we use the last purchased items first when selling:

- Beginning inventory: 20,000 units at $13
- 1/20 Purchase: 30,000 units at $15
- 1/23 Purchase: 40,000 units at $17

For the month of January, the last purchase of 40,000 units at $17 per unit will be used in COGS calculation, as it's the most recent addition.

Total COGS = 40,000 units * $17
Total COGS = $680,000

However, since there were 50,000 units sold at $20 each, we need to consider only the units that were part of the ending inventory, which is the latest purchase:

Ending inventory = 40,000 units - (50,000 units - 40,000 units) = 30,000 units
Cost of ending inventory = 30,000 units * $17
Cost of ending inventory = $510,000

Since the beginning inventory is not part of the COGS for the month, we subtract the cost of ending inventory from the total cost of the latest purchase:

COGS for January = $680,000 - $510,000
COGS for January = $710,000

So, the correct answer is A. $710,000.

The taxable income for Vital Corp. should be the book income minus the refund received, since refunds reduce taxable income. So, we subtract the state franchise tax refund from the book income:

$500,000 (book income) - $50,000 (refund) = $450,000

However, the municipal bond interest income is tax-exempt, so it should not be included in taxable income for Form 1120. Therefore, the correct amount for Vital's year 2 taxable income on Schedule M-1 is $450,000 minus the $7,500 bond interest income:

$450,000 - $7,500 = $442,500

So the answer is D. $442,500.

The cash-basis income for the month will increase by the amount of accrued expenses that have not yet been collected. In this case:

- Credit sales of $5600 are already included in cash basis since they were received.
- Collections of $1900 relate to January credit sales, so they decrease cash basis by $1900.
- Accrued salaries of $1200 have not been collected, so they should be added back to the cash basis.

So the increase in cash-basis income is $1200 (accrued salaries) - $1900 (collections) = $4900.

Therefore, the answer is D. $4900.

The production budget should show the units to be produced to meet the inventory targets and the projected sales. Since the quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter is to equal 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales, we can calculate the inventory for each quarter based on this information.

- End of Q1 inventory = 30% of Q2 sales = 0.30 * 40000 = 12000 units
- Beginning inventory (Q1) = 9000 units
- Ending inventory (Q1) = 12000 units

To find the production for Q1, we subtract the beginning inventory from the ending inventory and add that to the sales forecast for Q1:

Production (Q1) = Ending inventory (Q1) - Beginning inventory + Sales forecast (Q1)
Production (Q1) = 12000 - 9000 + 30000
Production (Q1) = 30000 + 30000
Production (Q1) = 60000

However, since this is the total production for the year and the sales budget is for units, we need to adjust for the fact that the production will be spread across the year. Since there are 3 quarters left in the year after Q1, we divide the total production for the year by 4:

Production (Q1) = 60000 / 4
Production (Q1) = 15000

But the answer choices don't have a 15000 option, so the most reasonable interpretation of the question is that it's asking for the production needed to meet the inventory target _only_ for the first quarter. In this case, the production for the first quarter would be 30000 (the projected sales), not the 15000 derived from the year's total.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. 30000

The indirect method for preparing a statement of cash flows for a not-for-profit organization starts with net income and adjusts it for items that do not affect cash but impact net income. Depreciation is an example of an expense that does not result in a direct outflow of cash but is recognized in the income statement. Therefore, it needs to be added back to net income to calculate net cash provided by operating activities.

To calculate earnings per share (EPS), we need to consider both common and preferred shares, as well as any dividends paid on preferred stock.

For common shares:
- Shares outstanding at beginning of the year: 120,000
- Shares issued during the year: 40,000
- Total common shares for EPS calculation: 120,000 + 40,000 = 160,000

Net income for the year: $480,000

For preferred shares:
- Dividend per preferred share: $5
- Number of preferred shares: 10,000
- Total dividend paid to preferred shareholders: 10,000 * $5 = $50,000 (which reduces net income)

Adjusted net income for common shareholders: $480,000 - $50,000 = $430,000

Now we can calculate EPS:
EPS = Adjusted net income / Total common shares
EPS = $430,000 / 160,000
EPS = $2.6875

Rounded to two decimal places, the answer is:

A. $2.69

The double-declining balance method calculates depreciation by depreciating the asset at twice the straight-line rate each year. First, we find the straight-line rate:

Straight-line rate = (Salvage value / Book value) * 100
Straight-line rate = ($1500 / ($12000 - $1500)) * 100
Straight-line rate = ($1500 / $10500) * 100
Straight-line rate ≈ 14.29%

Now, we calculate the book value after one year (before applying double-declining):

Book value after 1 year = Cost - Straight-line depreciation for 1 year
Book value after 1 year = $12000 - ($12000 * 14.29 / 100)
Book value after 1 year = $12000 - $1714.29
Book value after 1 year ≈ $10285.71

For the double-declining method, we use the straight-line rate for the first year:

Depreciation expense for year 1 (double-declining) = Book value after 1 year * Double-straight-line rate
Depreciation expense for year 1 = $10285.71 * (2 * 14.29 / 100)
Depreciation expense for year 1 ≈ $10285.71 * 0.2857
Depreciation expense for year 1 ≈ $2,922.23

Since the options provided do not include this exact amount, we need to round to the nearest whole dollar. The closest option is C. $5,333, which is likely a misformatted or incorrect option. Given the calculations, the correct answer should be closer to $2,922. However, without more context, I'll choose the closest reasonable option that could potentially be a rounding error.

The cost per equivalent whole unit can be calculated by first finding the total production cost and then dividing by the number of completed units.

1. Total production cost:
- Direct materials: $114,000
- Direct labor: $38,000
- Manufacturing overhead (50% of direct materials): \(0.50 \times 114,000 = 57,000\)

Total production cost = Direct materials + Direct labor + Overhead = $114,000 + $38,000 + $57,000 = $219,000

2. Cost per equivalent whole unit (for 9,000 completed units):
- Since the work in process is 50% complete as to conversion, we have 50% of the 10,000 units completed. So, equivalent units completed for conversion = 5,000 units.
- Total equivalent units = Completed units + Equivalent units for conversion = 9,000 + 5,000 = 14,000 units

Cost per equivalent whole unit = Total production cost / Total equivalent units = $219,000 / 14,000 = $15.40

Question: A company's current ratio is 2:1. This means that:
A. The company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities.
B. The company has twice as many current liabilities as current assets.
C. The company's current assets are equal to its current liabilities.
D. The company's current assets are half of its current liabilities.
Answer: A
================================================================================================================================
The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 includes the initial purchase cost, shipping, and installation costs. 

- Initial cost: $475,000
- Shipping and installation: $5,000
- Total at time 0: $475,000 + $5,000 = $480,000

Depreciation for 4 years (MACRS 3-year class) is:
- Annual depreciation: ($475,000 - $120,000) / 4 years = ($355,000 / 4) = $88,750
- Tax shield (34%): $88,750 * 0.34
- Net annual tax saving: $65,000 - (Tax shield)

First year's tax saving will be used to offset part of the initial investment, so we calculate the remaining tax savings after one year:
- Year 1: $65,000 - (Tax shield for Year 1)
- Remaining years: $65,000 * (3 years - 1) = $130,000

Now, we need to find the total incremental cash outflow considering depreciation and tax savings:

- Year 1: $480,000 - (Tax savings from Year 1)
- Year 2-4: $480,000 - $88,750 * 3 + $130,000 * 2

Let's calculate the total:
Year 1: $480,000 - ($65,000 - Tax shield for Year 1)
Year 2-4: $480,000 - $266,250 + $260,000

Since we don't have the exact tax shield for Year 1, we'll assume it's the maximum possible, which would minimize the incremental cash outflow. So, let's use the full $65,000 as the tax shield for Year 1:

Year 1: $480,000 - ($65,000)
Year 2-4: $480,000 - $266,250 + $260,000 = $273,750

Total for Years 1-4: $415,000 (Year 1) + $273,750 (Years 2-4) = $688,750

The incremental cash outflow at time 0 is closest to this amount, which is closest to option D. However, since the options provided don't include the exact amount, we can only confidently say that it's less than $580,000.

Given the choices, the closest would be:
D. $480,000.00 (This is the initial investment, but since it doesn't account for the tax savings, it's likely not the correct answer. The actual answer should be slightly less than $580,000.)

The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. If the current ratio is 3-to-1, this means that for every $1 in current liabilities, there are $3 in current assets.

The quick ratio, also known as the acid-test ratio, is similar but excludes inventory from current assets. Since the quick ratio is 1-to-1, for every $1 in current liabilities, there is $1 in (current assets - inventory).

Let's denote the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses as \( I \). The current assets can be represented as:

\[ \text{Current Assets} = \text{Inventory} + \text{Prepaid Expenses} + \text{Other Current Assets} \]

From the quick ratio:
\[ \frac{\text{Current Assets} - I}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Current Assets} - I = \text{Current Liabilities} \]

Given that \(\text{Current Liabilities} = $322,000\) and \(\text{Current Assets} = 3 \times \text{Current Liabilities}\) because of the current ratio:
\[ 3 \times 322,000 - I = 322,000 \]
\[ 966,000 - I = 322,000 \]
\[ I = 966,000 - 322,000 \]
\[ I = 644,000 \]

So the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000.

The times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by interest expense. 

First, we need to calculate EBIT:
EBIT = Income after tax + Interest expense + Depreciation expense
EBIT = $5.4 million + $1 million + $1 million
EBIT = $7.4 million

Now, we use the TIE formula:
TIE = EBIT / Interest expense
TIE = $7.4 million / $1 million
TIE = 7.4

So the correct answer is:
C. 7.4

To calculate the carrying amount of the machine using the double-declining balance (DDB) method, we need to know the depreciation rate for this method, which is typically twice the straight-line rate (2/expected life). Since the straight-line rate is 1/expected life, the DDB rate is 2/8 = 1/4.

For the first year:
Depreciation = Cost - Salvage Value / Estimated Life
Depreciation = $140,000 - $60,000 / 8
Depreciation = $80,000 / 8
Depreciation = $10,000

At the end of the first year, the carrying amount = $140,000 - $10,000 = $130,000.

For the second year:
Depreciation = (Cost - Depreciation in Year 1 - Salvage Value) / Estimated Life
Depreciation = ($140,000 - $10,000 - $60,000) / 8
Depreciation = $70,000 / 8
Depreciation = $8,750

At the end of the second year, the carrying amount = $130,000 - $8,750 = $121,250.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. $61,250

This calculation is incorrect because it seems to mix up the straight-line and double-declining balance methods. The correct carrying amount at the end of the second year using the DDB method would be less than $130,000, not $61,250. However, none of the provided options match the calculated amount. It's possible that there might be an error in the options given, but based on the information provided, none of the choices exactly match the calculated result.

The amortization expense for an intangible asset like a copyright is calculated by dividing the cost of the asset by its useful life. In this case, the copyright has a legal life of 50 years plus the life of the author (which we don't have specific information about, so we'll assume it's at least 1 year), so at least 51 years. Since Corbet expects to sell the book for only 5 years, the useful life for accounting purposes would be the shorter of the legal life or the expected economic benefit, which is 5 years.

Amortization Expense = Cost / Useful Life
Amortization Expense = $20,000 / 5 years
Amortization Expense = $4,000 per year

Therefore, the amortization expense for the end of the current year would be $4,000. The answer is B, $4,000.
================================================================================================================================
B

The correct answer is B. Since Large City does not use the modified approach (which is typically used for capitalizing certain infrastructure improvements), it would expense the entire cost of the new roads in the same year. Therefore, the $800,000 spent on new roads should be recognized as an expense in the current year, divided by the useful life of 20 years. So, $800,000 / 20 = $40,000 per year.

The shareholder contributes the equipment to the S corporation in exchange for stock. Since the fair market value of the equipment is $20,000 and the shareholder's basis is only $6,000, there is a difference of $14,000 ($20,000 - $6,000) which represents a gain. However, in an S corporation, passive losses from the sale of assets can be passed through to the shareholders' personal tax returns, reducing their taxable income. In this case, the $12,000 liability reduces the recognized gain to $2,000 ($14,000 - $12,000). But the question asks for the gain without considering the liability, so the answer is $12,000. The $8,000 mentioned in option C is incorrect because it does not account for the full $14,000 gain before considering the liability.

The calculation to find the net present value (NPV) requires discounting the future cash inflows back to their present value using the given discount rate. Using the formula:

NPV = -Initial Investment + \(\frac{Cash Inflow_1}{(1 + Discount Rate)^1} + \frac{Cash Inflow_2}{(1 + Discount Rate)^2} + ... + \frac{Cash Inflow_n}{(1 + Discount Rate)^n}\)

For a 10% discount rate and cash inflows of $3,000 for 5 years, starting from year 1:

NPV = -11,000 + \(\frac{3,000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} + \frac{3,000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} + \frac{3,000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} + \frac{3,000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} + \frac{3,000}{(1 + 0.10)^5}\)

Let's calculate:

NPV = -11,000 + \(3,000 \times \frac{1}{1.10} + 3,000 \times \frac{1}{1.10^2} + 3,000 \times \frac{1}{1.10^3} + 3,000 \times \frac{1}{1.10^4} + 3,000 \times \frac{1}{1.10^5}\)

NPV = -11,000 + \(2,727.27 + 2,454.55 + 2,209.09 + 1,980.19 + 1,767.16\)

Now, let's add these numbers:

-11,000 + 12,138.16 ≈ -9,500

The correct answer is B. $1,600.

Baker purchased the equipment on May 1 of the prior year, so it would have been in use for approximately 10 months (May to December) in the first year and all of the second year (12 months) before being sold on March 1 of the current year.

Under the MACRS depreciation method:

- In the first year, the depreciation deduction would be 20% of the cost ($10,000).
- In the second year, the remaining book value after the first year would be depreciated by another 32%.

To calculate the first-year depreciation:
\( \text{Depreciation} = \frac{20\%}{5} \times \text{Cost} = \frac{20}{5} \times 10,000 = 4,000 \)

Since Baker used the equipment for 10 months of the first year, we need to adjust the depreciation for partial year:
\( \text{Partial-year depreciation} = \frac{10}{12} \times 4,000 = \frac{5}{3} \times 4,000 = \frac{20,000}{3} \approx 6,667 \)

For the second year, since it was fully used:
\( \text{Depreciation (second year)} = \frac{32\%}{5} \times (10,000 - 4,000) = \frac{32}{5} \times 6,000 = 32 \times 1,200 = 3,840 \)

Adding both years:
\( \text{Total depreciation} = 6,667 + 3,840 = 10,507 \)

However, this is for two years. To find the depreciation for the current year only (which includes 10 months of the second year), we need to adjust the second-year amount:
\( \text{Current-year depreciation} = \frac{10}{12} \times 3,840 \approx \frac{5}{3} \times 3,840 = 1,920 \)

The closest option to this is B. $1,600, which is likely a rounding error or a typo. Given the calculations, the correct answer should be closer to $1,920.

An increase in the credit period typically results in a longer time for customers to pay their invoices, which could lead to an increase in the average collection period since it takes longer to collect cash from those customers. This might not directly result in a decrease in bad debt losses, as it could also potentially increase the risk of non-payment if customers take full advantage of the extended credit period. However, it may not necessarily lead to an immediate increase in sales or higher profits, as the effect on these metrics depends on various factors such as customer behavior, market conditions, and the cost of extending credit. Therefore, the most direct impact would be on the average collection period.

An auditor replacing a voided purchase order with another in the event of a match with a random number indicates that the auditor is looking for proper approval processes, including voiding procedures that are functioning correctly. If the voided purchase order has been properly voided in the normal course of business, it suggests that the internal control is effective, and the auditor can continue with the sampling process, assuming the voiding is a valid reason.

Therefore, the answer is B. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.

To calculate the beta of Stock A, we use the formula:

\[ \beta = \frac{\text{Covariance}(A, \text{Market})}{\text{Standard Deviation}(A) \times \text{Standard Deviation}(Market)} \]

Given:
- Covariance(A, Market) = 88
- Standard Deviation(A) = 19%
- Standard Deviation(Market) = 14%

First, convert the percentages to decimals:
- Standard Deviation(A) = 0.19
- Standard Deviation(Market) = 0.14

Now, calculate the beta:
\[ \beta = \frac{88}{0.19 \times 0.14} \]
\[ \beta = \frac{88}{0.0266} \]
\[ \beta \approx 331.74 \]

Since beta is typically rounded to two decimal places, the closest option is:

D. 0.45

Beta values are usually presented as whole numbers or two decimal places, so rounding down to two decimal places gives us 0.45.

The correct answer is D. Stark Co. should not accrue the liability until there is a better understanding of the potential outcome, as it is still considered a contingency. However, Stark should disclose the contingent liability in its December 31 financial statements, providing a range of possible amounts based on the lawyer's assessment (from $100,000 to $150,000). This is in accordance with the requirement to disclose information about known contingencies that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Accrual of the liability would only happen if the likelihood of the loss becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

The correct answer is C, $150,000. Dari has determined that a payment of $150,000 to $200,000 is probable (more likely than not) within the next six months. The amount of the contingent liability to be recognized should be the lower end of this range, which is $150,000. Since there is no amount more likely, there is no need to recognize the higher amount.

To calculate the standard deviation of an equal-weighted portfolio, we can use the formula:

\[
\sigma_{p} = \sqrt{w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2}
\]

where:
- \( \sigma_p \) is the portfolio standard deviation,
- \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) are the weights of stocks A and B (equal weights, so \( w_1 = w_2 = 0.5 \)),
- \( \sigma_1 \) and \( \sigma_2 \) are the standard deviations of stocks A and B,
- \( \rho \) is the correlation between stocks A and B.

Plugging in the values given:
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{(0.5)^2 \times (6\%)^2 + (0.5)^2 \times (18\%)^2 + 2(0.5)(0.5)(0.2)(6\%)(18\%)}
\]
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.25 \times 0.36 + 0.25 \times 3.24 + 0.5 \times 0.216}
\]
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.09 + 0.81 + 0.108}
\]
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{1.008}
\]
\[
\sigma_p \approx 1.004
\]

Since percentages are usually expressed as decimals, the standard deviation of the portfolio is approximately 1.004 * 100%, which rounds to 10.04%.

The closest answer choice is D. 9.70%, which is the closest approximation without going beyond the options given.

To calculate the profit in U.S. dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the cost in pesos to U.S. dollars:
   Cost in Pesos = 116.50
   Exchange rate (Pesos to Dollars) = 0.1099
   Cost in Dollars = Cost in Pesos / Exchange rate
   Cost in Dollars = 116.50 / 0.1099

2. Convert the selling price in euros to U.S. dollars:
   Selling Price in Euros = 20
   Exchange rate (Euros to Dollars) = 0.8928
   Selling Price in Dollars = Selling Price in Euros / Exchange rate
   Selling Price in Dollars = 20 / 0.8928

3. Calculate profit:
   Profit = Selling Price in Dollars - Cost in Dollars

Let's do the calculations:

Cost in Dollars = 116.50 / 0.1099 ≈ $1,061.41
Selling Price in Dollars = 20 / 0.8928 ≈ $22.40

Profit = $22.40 - $1,061.41 ≈ $-1,038.99

However, the profit cannot be negative. It seems there might be an error in the exchange rates provided or the problem setup, as the profit should be positive for a sale.

Strom contributed land with an adjusted basis of $16,000 and a fair market value of $50,000 to acquire a 25% interest in Ace Partnership. The land had a mortgage of $24,000, which was assumed by Ace. Strom's basis in Ace would be the adjusted basis of the land plus its share of the liabilities taken over:

- Strom's share of the mortgage = 25% of $24,000 = $6,000
- Total basis in Ace = $16,000 (basis of land) + $6,000 (assumed mortgage) = $22,000

However, since there is no other liability mentioned, it seems that only the mortgage is included in the basis calculation. Therefore, Strom's basis in Ace is $26,000 (the sum of the adjusted basis and the mortgage assumption).

To find the break-even point, we need to determine the number of DVD players that will cover both variable costs (for DVD players and home entertainment systems) and fixed costs.

Let's calculate the contribution margin for each product:
- Contribution margin per DVD player = Selling price - Variable cost per DVD player = $200 - $160 = $40
- Contribution margin per home entertainment system = Selling price - Variable cost per system = $600 - $460 = $140
Since 1 home entertainment system equals 4 DVD players, the combined contribution margin for 4 DVD players is:
$40 (per DVD player) * 4 = $160

Now, we need to cover the fixed costs of $90,000 with these combined contributions:
Number of DVD player units to cover fixed costs = Fixed costs / Combined contribution margin per 4 DVD players
$90,000 / $160 = 562.5

Since you can't sell a fraction of a DVD player, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 563 DVD players.

However, since we're asked for the number of DVD players to break even without considering home entertainment systems, we'll use the contribution margin from just the DVD players:

Number of DVD players to break even (for fixed costs only) = Fixed costs / Contribution margin per DVD player
$90,000 / $40 = 2250

So, the company needs to sell 2250 DVD players to break even, but since we're looking for the minimum number considering the given sales mix (one home entertainment system for every four DVD players), we need to divide this by 4:

2250 / 4 = 562.5

Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, the answer is 563 DVD players.

None of the options exactly match, but since the closest option is D. 1500, it seems like there might be an error in the question or the options provided. The correct answer should be closer to 563, so if there's a typo or an extra condition, the correct answer would be D (1500). However, without further context, the most reasonable answer based on the calculation is D.

To calculate the profit margin on sales (return on sales or ROS), you can use the following formula:

ROS = Net Profit Margin / Asset Turnover

Given:
ROA (Return on Assets) = 10% or 0.10 (as a decimal)
Asset Turnover = 4:1 or 4 (since it's a ratio, we don't need to convert it)

Now, we can rearrange the formula to find the profit margin on sales:

Profit Margin on Sales = ROA * Asset Turnover
Profit Margin on Sales = 0.10 * 4
Profit Margin on Sales = 0.40 or 4.00%

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 4.00%.

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is sensitive to the time value of money and the cash flows of the project, so it can change the ranking of projects based on the specific assumptions. On the other hand, Net Present Value (NPV), which discounts future cash flows to their present value, is not invariant to changes in the market rate. It means that the ranking of projects by NPV can change with different discount rates. Therefore, option C is correct, as the IRR does not always agree with the NPV and can lead to different rankings. Using a single metric for comparison without considering the underlying principles of each is generally not recommended.

The price of a growing perpetuity can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P = \frac{D}{r - g} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the current share price,
- \( D \) is the current dividend,
- \( r \) is the required return on equity (12%),
- \( g \) is the growth rate of the dividend.

Given:
- \( D = $3 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \)
- \( P = $75 \)

We need to find \( g \):

\[ $75 = \frac{3}{0.12 - g} \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( g \):

\[ g = 0.12 - \frac{3}{75} \]
\[ g = 0.12 - 0.04 \]
\[ g = 0.08 \]

So, the dividend growth rate should be 8%.

D. 13.53 percent.

The effective annual interest cost can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate interest on borrowed amount:
   Interest = Principal * Interest Rate
   Interest = $200,000 * 10% = $20,000

2. Calculate commitment fee on unused amount:
   Since $300,000 (credit limit - $200,000 borrowed) is unused, commitment fee = 1% * $300,000 = $3,000

3. Add both components to find the effective annual interest cost:
   Effective Interest Cost = Interest + Commitment Fee
   Effective Interest Cost = $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000

4. Convert to an annual percentage:
   Effective Annual Interest Cost (as a percentage) = ($23,000 / $200,000) * 365 days / 360 days ≈ 13.53%

Therefore, the correct answer is D. 13.53 percent.

The expected value (EV) is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing them up. For Smith Legal Services:

- If the award is $100,000 (probability 0.7):
  - Retainer: $20,000
  - Additional 40% of $80,000 ($100,000 - $20,000): $24,000
  Total: $20,000 + $24,000 = $44,000
- If the award is $0 (probability 0.3):
  - Only the retainer: $20,000

Expected Value = (Probability of $100,000 * Value of $100,000) + (Probability of $0 * Value of $0)
Expected Value = (0.7 * $44,000) + (0.3 * $20,000)
Expected Value = $30,800 + $6,000
Expected Value = $36,800

However, we need to subtract Smith's out-of-pocket expenses, which are $15,000:
$36,800 - $15,000 = $21,800

So the closest answer is $25,900, which rounds down from $21,800.

To calculate the holding period return, we need to consider both the initial investment and the final proceeds.

Initial investment: $104.10 (price at issuance)
Face value: $100 (coupon payments)

Coupons received over 3 years:
- Annual coupon payment: 8% of $100 = $8
- Since the bond is sold after 3 years, we receive 3 * $8 = $24 in coupons

Final proceeds: $82 (selling price at the end of the third year)

Holding Period Return (HPR) formula is:
\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Final Proceeds} - \text{Initial Investment} + \text{Total Coupons}}{\text{Initial Investment}} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{82 - 104.10 + 24}{104.10} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{-22.10 + 24}{104.10} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{1.90}{104.10} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{HPR} \approx -0.0181 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{HPR} \approx -1.81\% \]

Since the HPR is negative, it indicates a loss. The given options do not have a -1.81% option, but the closest negative percentage is -21%. So, the correct answer is C. -21%. This assumes that the bond was sold at a discount to par value, resulting in a larger loss than just the difference in the selling price and the purchase price.

The taxable income as reconciled on Prime's Schedule M-1 would be the book income minus the non-taxable items. Book income is $300,000. The $17,000 corporate bond interest income is taxable. However, the $20,000 life insurance premium is not tax-deductible since it benefits the corporation's officers (as the policy owner and beneficiary), so it's not considered an employee benefit. Therefore, the taxable income is:

$300,000 (book income) - $17,000 (taxable interest) = $283,000.

The standard deviation of a portfolio can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Portfolio Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\omega_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + \omega_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2\omega_A\omega_B\rho_{AB}\sigma_A\sigma_B} \]

where:
- \( \omega_A \) and \( \omega_B \) are the weights of securities A and B, respectively,
- \( \sigma_A \) and \( \sigma_B \) are the standard deviations of securities A and B, and
- \( \rho_{AB} \) is the correlation between the two securities.

Given:
- \( \omega_A = \frac{1}{4} \), \( \omega_B = \frac{3}{4} \) (since 1/4 is invested in A and 3/4 in B),
- \( \sigma_A = 8\% \), \( \sigma_B = 18\% \),
- \( \rho_{AB} = -0.20 \),

Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Portfolio SD} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 (0.08)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 (0.18)^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)(-0.20)(0.08)(0.18)} \]
\[ \text{Portfolio SD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16}(0.0064) + \frac{9}{16}(0.0324) - 0.0072} \]
\[ \text{Portfolio SD} = \sqrt{0.0004 + 0.02916 - 0.0072} \]
\[ \text{Portfolio SD} = \sqrt{0.02236} \]
\[ \text{Portfolio SD} \approx 0.1493 \]

Converted to percentage, this is approximately 14.93%. The closest option is B. 13.20%.

The unrealized gain on a debt investment classified as available-for-sale is typically included in other comprehensive income until it is realized through a sale or the instrument is derecognized. Since Cooley Co. has not sold the investment and the corporate tax rate is applied to the realized gain, only $25,000 ($100,000 * 25%) would be recognized as taxable income (net income) in the current year. The remaining $75,000 remains in other comprehensive income. Therefore, the answer is:

Net income: $25,000
Other comprehensive income: $75,000

The value of an infinite stream of growing cash flows can be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model formula, which is:

\[ \text{Value} = \frac{\text{Next Cash Flow}}{\text{Market Discount Rate} - \text{Growth Rate}} \]

Given:
- Next Cash Flow = $10
- Market Discount Rate (r) = 15%
- Growth Rate (g) = 5%

\[ \text{Value} = \frac{10}{15\% - 5\%} = \frac{10}{10\%} = \frac{10}{0.10} = 100 \]

However, since the growth rate is lower than the market discount rate, the present value will actually be less than the next cash flow because the future cash flows are discounted at a higher rate. The correct answer should be $1, as the value of the investment is less than $10 due to the high discount rate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

To calculate the ending accounts receivable balance, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Ending Accounts Receivable} = \frac{\text{Cash Sales}}{\text{Average Collection Period Days}} \times \text{Number of Days in the Year} - \text{Total Sales} \]

Given:
- Cash Sales = $25 million
- Average Collection Period Days = 36 days
- Total Sales = $265 million
- Number of Days in the Year = 365 days

Let's do the calculation:

\[ \text{Ending Accounts Receivable} = \frac{25}{36} \times 365 - 265 \]
\[ \text{Ending Accounts Receivable} = \frac{25 \times 365}{36} - 265 \]
\[ \text{Ending Accounts Receivable} = \frac{9125}{36} - 265 \]
\[ \text{Ending Accounts Receivable} \approx 253.47 - 265 \]
\[ \text{Ending Accounts Receivable} \approx -11.53 \]

Since the balance cannot be negative, the closest answer is the one that is closest to zero, which is $0$. However, since none of the options exactly represent zero, we look at the closest positive values:

The Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) method calculates the yield of a short-term security, like a Treasury bill, by converting it to a bond with a similar maturity. For a 13-week Treasury bill, we can assume it's equivalent to a 4% annualized yield (since 13 weeks is approximately 1/3 of a year).

To calculate the BEY, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{BEY} = \left( \frac{\text{Price Paid}}{\text{Face Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Time in Years}}} - 1 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{BEY} = \left( \frac{960}{1000} \right)^{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{3}}} - 1 \]
\[ \text{BEY} = (0.96)^3 - 1 \]
\[ \text{BEY} \approx 0.9216 - 1 \]
\[ \text{BEY} \approx -0.0784 \]

Converting the negative yield to a percentage, we get:

\[ \text{BEY} \approx -7.84\% \]

Since the yield cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:

\[ \text{BEY} \approx 7.84\% \]

D. The useful life of a fixed asset is determined by the first time it is used, not when it is acquired.
Answer:
================================================================================================================================
To calculate the amount of stock investments reported in the year-end statement of financial position, we add up the cost basis of the investments and their fair values at the end of the year.

For Stock A:
- 100 shares * $50 per share = $5,000 initial cost
- $51 per share * 100 shares = $5,100 current fair value

For Stock B:
- 200 shares * $40 per share = $8,000 initial cost
- $49 per share * 200 shares = $9,800 current fair value

Total stock investments = $5,000 (Stock A) + $8,000 (Stock B) + $5,100 (ending value of Stock A) + $9,800 (ending value of Stock B)
Total stock investments = $5,000 + $8,000 + $5,100 + $9,800 = $28,000

Answer: D. $14,900 (This is likely a typo or not the correct answer based on the calculation above. The correct answer should be $28,000.)

The correct calculation for the salaries expense for the month ended June 30 is based on the number of workdays since the last payday (June 18) until June 30, which is 10 days (not including the payday), plus the amount already recorded before the accrual.

Since the $14,000 was already in the account for the 10 days prior to June 30, we need to add the remaining 10 days' worth of expense. Assuming a consistent daily expense rate, we can calculate it as follows:

10 days * (10,000 / 10 workdays) = $10,000

So, the total salaries expense for June is $14,000 (already recorded) + $10,000 (additional 10 days) = $24,000.

To calculate the payback period, we need to find out how much the company needs to invest to recover its initial investment within 5.2 years, considering annual revenues and operating expenses.

Annual cash inflow (before depreciation):
Revenues: $35,000
Operating expenses: $7,000 (excluding depreciation)

Operating cash flow = Revenues - Operating expenses = $35,000 - $7,000 = $28,000 (since depreciation is included in operating expenses)

The company wants to recover its investment within 5.2 years, so the total cash inflows needed for payback:
$28,000 * 5.2 years

Now, let's find the cost of the machine:

Initial investment = Total cash inflows for payback
Initial investment = $28,000 * 5.2

Let's calculate the value:
Initial investment = $28,000 * 5.2 = $145,600

So, the company paid $145,600 for the new machine.

Answer: A. $145,600
================================================================================================================================
D. Operating income.

Operating income is typically subject to intraperiod income tax allocation, as it is part of the company's normal business activities and taxes are calculated on these earnings. Discontinued operations, extraordinary gains and losses, and income from continuing operations may also be subject to tax allocation depending on the circumstances.
================================================================================================================================

The decision to acquire the machine should be based on the net present value (NPV) of the cash inflows it will generate. We calculate the NPV by discounting the expected cash inflows back to the present value using the given cost of capital:

NPV = -Cost of Machine + \(\frac{Cash Inflow}{(1 + Cost of Capital)^1} + \frac{Cash Inflow}{(1 + Cost of Capital)^2} + \frac{Cash Inflow}{(1 + Cost of Capital)^3}\)

NPV = -80,000 + \(\frac{25,000}{1.10} + \frac{25,000}{1.10^2} + \frac{25,000}{1.10^3}\)

NPV ≈ -80,000 + 22,727.27 + 20,548.15 + 18,679.09

NPV ≈ -75,000 (rounded)

Since the NPV is negative, the machine would result in a loss after accounting for the initial cost. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as the net present value is negative ($750), indicating that the project is not financially viable according to Skytop's cost of capital.

The labor rate variance and efficiency variance being unfavorable means that the actual costs were higher than the standard costs. Writing these variances off directly to cost of goods sold increases the COGS, which in turn reduces net income since it reduces the gross profit. However, this does not affect the current ratio, which is calculated as current assets (including inventory) divided by current liabilities. Since Dawn's inventory (work in process finished goods) may not have changed significantly due to the write-off, the current ratio might still be influenced by other factors and could potentially increase if the write-off did not lead to a significant decrease in current assets.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Increases Decreases
