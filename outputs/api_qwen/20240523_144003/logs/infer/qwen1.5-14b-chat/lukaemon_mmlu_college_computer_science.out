The access matrix approach to protection in computer security indeed faces the issue that the matrix, which represents permissions between users and resources, can become large and cumbersome to manage when there are many users, resources, and permissions. Storing and managing such a matrix directly can be inefficient and error-prone. Option A correctly captures this difficulty.

Option B is incorrect because access matrices can express complex protection requirements, given proper design. Option C is false because access control decisions are typically decidable, although they can become complex in some cases. Option D is not a difficulty inherent to the access matrix approach; it's more of a practical concern related to maintaining and modifying the matrix rather than a fundamental limitation of the concept.

Explanation: Common divisors of two integers must be positive integers because they divide both numbers without leaving a remainder. Set B includes 0, which is not a divisor, so it's not correct. Set D also includes 0, so it's also incorrect. Set C includes negative numbers, which are not valid divisors of positive integers, so it's not correct either. Set A consists only of positive integers that could potentially divide any pair of integers without leaving a remainder, so the answer is A.

Explanation: In a collection of undirected graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges, we need to maximize the number of connected components while still having a total of 6 edges. To do this, we can form a tree-like structure, where one large component has 5 nodes connected by 4 edges, and the remaining 5 nodes form separate components with no connections to the first component. This would give us a maximum of 1 (the large component) + 5 (small components) = 6 connected components (M = 7).

To minimize the number of connected components (m), we want to create a scenario where almost all edges connect different pairs of nodes, leaving only a few to connect isolated nodes. One way to achieve this is to have a single large clique of 5 nodes connected by 4 edges, and then connect the remaining 5 nodes to this clique, each node forming a separate component. This would result in 1 large component and 4 isolated nodes, giving us m = 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is M = 7 and m = 4.

The resolution theorem proving method is indeed a sound proof system, meaning that it never proves the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula. It is also complete for propositional logic, ensuring that for any unsatisfiable formula, there exists a resolution proof. However, it is not necessarily succinct, as the length of the proof may grow exponentially with the size of the input formula, making it non-polynomial in the worst case. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A purely segmented memory system does not divide memory into units of equal size, so statement I is incorrect. Virtual memory is typically implemented in paging systems rather than segmentation, so statement II is also incorrect. Segmented systems often suffer from internal fragmentation because each segment has its own address space, leading to unused portions within segments even when the overall memory is not fully allocated. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it only includes the property of internal fragmentation.

The hash function h(i) = i mod 5 is used, so we calculate the hash values for each key:

- Key 13: 13 % 5 = 3
- Key 8: 8 % 5 = 3 (collision with key 13)
- Key 24: 24 % 5 = 4
- Key 10: 10 % 5 = 0 (collision with key 3, but since we use linear resolution, we move to next slot)
- Key 3: 3 % 5 = 3 (another collision with key 13)

Since key 10 collides with key 3 and we resolve collisions by moving to the next slot, key 10 will end up in bucket 0, and key 3 will stay in bucket 3. Key 8 will also remain in bucket 3 due to the collision.

Therefore, the content of the bucket numbered 2 is empty because none of the keys hash to 2.

The correct answer is D because:

- Statement I (P has a local variable) is not necessarily true for a terminating recursive procedure. Recursive procedures can be written without local variables, for example, using tail recursion optimization where the recursive call is the last operation in the function, allowing the compiler or interpreter to optimize it away.

- Statement II (P has an execution path where it does not call itself) is true for terminating recursive procedures. There must be at least one base case or termination condition that is reached without further recursion.

- Statement III (P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter) is true because a procedure, whether recursive or not, typically needs some way to access data (either through parameters or global variables) to perform its task.

So, the combination of II and III must be true for a terminating recursive procedure, making option D the correct answer.

Explanation: Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for each other to release resources they need, and none of them can proceed. Option A prevents deadlock by prioritizing processes and allowing higher-priority processes to take resources from lower-priority ones, breaking circular waits. Option B prevents deadlock by ensuring that processes acquire all necessary resources at once, reducing the chance of a deadlock situation. Option C does not prevent deadlock because it only orders the requests, not the allocation of resources, so processes could still get stuck in a circular wait. Option D introduces a time-out mechanism, which can help break the deadlock if a process times out and releases its resources, allowing others to proceed.

Therefore, the answer is C.

Explanation: Magic memory can be used to implement a Test-and-Set operation because a Read operation can check if the memory has been cleared since the last Read, simulating a Test operation, and then Clearing it to perform a Set operation. This meets the criteria for Test-and-Set. It can also be used to coordinate processes on a shared-memory multiprocessor system, as it provides a consistent view of the state between reads and clears. So, both I and II are true. The use of "Magic memory" does not inherently require a multiprocessor system, so III is not necessarily true.

Indirect representation through a stack pointer referencing heap storage typically does not increase compilation time significantly, as the overhead is usually in the runtime rather than the compile-time. Therefore, I is not true.

Direct representation allows for faster access to the components of a variable because they are stored directly on the stack, which is a fast memory location. This is true, so II is correct.

When the storage size of a private component changes, indirect representation can be more flexible because you can resize the heap allocation without needing to recompile modules that use the object. This is true, so III is also correct.

Thus, the correct answer is D, as both II and III are true statements about direct and indirect representations.

Explanation: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a mechanism that allows a program running on one computer (client) to call a subroutine or procedure on another computer (server), as if it were locally executed. The communication between the client and server can involve passing values, including by reference, and returning results. However, option D states that RPC cannot call procedures implemented in a different language, which is incorrect because RPC can indeed be used for cross-language communication. Option A refers to the addressing limitations, which is not a property of RPC but rather a detail of the system architecture; RPC does not inherently have such a limitation. Options B and C are also incorrect, as RPC can return values and pass parameters by reference.

Explanation: Since 40% of the computation is inherently sequential, this part will not be parallelizable. The remaining 60% can be divided among the processors. For 2 processors, we can divide the parallelizable work by 2, so the time is 100 seconds / 2 = 50 seconds. For 4 processors, we divide the parallelizable work by 4, so the time is 100 seconds / 4 = 25 seconds. The inherent sequential part remains the same for both cases.

Regular expressions are not expressive enough to describe all languages that have an unbounded difference between the number of ones and zeros. For example, the language "all bit strings with more ones than zeros" includes strings like 11111, 1111111, etc., which have an increasing number of ones and no upper bound on the difference. This property cannot be captured by a regular expression, which are limited to describing finite-state machines and patterns with a fixed structure.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Explanation: To express a condition with exactly three out of four variables being true, we can use the De Morgan's laws to convert "exactly three" into a combination of "at least three" and "not all." Let's represent the literals as follows:

- p1 = A
- p2 = B
- p3 = C
- p4 = D

To express "exactly three are true," we can say "A and B and C and not D" or "A and B and C or A and B and not C or A and not B and C." However, since we can't use the NOT operator directly, we can rewrite it as:

(A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ ¬(A ∨ B ∨ C ∨ D)

This can be simplified further to:

(A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ (¬A ∨ ¬B ∨ ¬C ∨ ¬D)

This formula uses the AND (∧) and OR (∨) operators, satisfying condition II.

Condition I, "at least three are true," can be expressed using the same formula because "at least three" includes the case where all four are true.

Condition III, "an even number of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true," cannot be expressed without the NOT operator, as it requires alternating true and false values, which cannot be achieved with just AND (∨) and OR (∨). 

Therefore, the correct answer is B, which includes only condition II.

A. Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument.

This is correct because currying is the technique of converting a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument, by successively applying them. It can be applied recursively to any function until it reaches a function with a single input. There is no inherent limitation on the number of arguments, as long as they can be broken down one at a time.

The loop iterates over the array A, accessing elements and modifying them. Since each iteration accesses `A[i]` and `B[2*i]`, and both accesses are within the same cache line (because they are consecutive array elements), we can analyze the cache behavior.

Array A has 256 elements and an 8-byte block size. With a direct-mapped cache, each cache block is mapped to a single physical address. The first element of A is at address 4,096, so the first cache block would also start at that address. As we access consecutive elements in A, all accesses will map to the same cache block.

Array B has twice the number of elements (512) but since we're only accessing `B[2*i]`, we'll access every second element of B. This means we'll access every other cache block in B's sequence, starting from the block containing `B[0]` which is at address 8,192. However, because the cache is direct-mapped and the block size is 8 bytes, accessing `B[2*i]` will also map to the same block as `A[i]` because they have the same index offset within their respective arrays.

Since we're only updating `A[i]` and not `B[2*i]`, we will write back the updated value of `A[i]` after each iteration. As we write back, we will overwrite the old value of `A[i]` in the cache, and there will be no eviction of `A[i]` or `B[2*i]` from the cache during the loop, because they are in the same cache block.

Therefore, no bytes from either array will be evicted to memory under a write-back policy, and all writes to `A[i]` will remain in the cache. The answer is:

A. 0

In Two's complement representation, addition of integers works correctly even for numbers that are outside the range of the given number of bits. In One's complement, adding a negative number (-42) to a positive number (109) could potentially overflow, as there is no inherent notion of borrowing. In Sign and Magnitude, addition also requires special handling to avoid overflow, as it doesn't have a separate bit to indicate the sign.

Therefore, Two's complement is the correct representation for adding 109 and -42 without going out of range, so the answer is B. II only.

A. h <= log2(N)

The height h of a strictly binary tree can be at most logarithmic in the number of nodes N, because each level of the tree adds at most one new node compared to the previous level. As the tree gets taller, the number of nodes doubles at each level (for balanced trees), so the height h would be at most log base 2 of N (as log2(N) gives the minimum number of levels needed to reach N nodes). Therefore, option A is correct.

Explanation: We can execute the assignments in stages to minimize the time. 

1. First, we perform A := B + C and E := B - C simultaneously, as they don't depend on each other's results. Time = 2.
2. Next, we update F := A + B, which uses the new value of A from step 1. Time = 1.
3. Now, we compute C := A * E, which depends on the result of E from step 1. Time = 1.
4. Finally, we calculate D := A / F, which uses the new values of A and F from steps 1 and 3. Time = 1.

Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. However, since the question asks for the minimum number of time units needed with the same result as if executed in the given order, and the given order would also take 5 time units (as each assignment is a separate unit), the answer is 3 because after the first two assignments, the remaining assignments can be done in parallel without waiting for the first two to finish.

Explanation: To determine if two expressions are unifiable, we need to check if they can be made identical after applying suitable variable substitutions.

- Expression I: `f(w, w)` - No substitution needed since it's already identical.
- Expression II: `f(x, 1)` - We can substitute `x` with `w` to make it `f(w, 1)`, so these are unifiable.
- Expression III: `f(y, g(z))` - We can't directly match this with I or II without more information about `g` and `z`. However, since `w` can be anything and `g(z)` could potentially be any function of `z`, we can't say for sure they're not unifiable without knowing the exact meaning of `g`.

Given the information, the pairs that are unifiable are (I, II) and (I, III), because we have shown how to make them identical in at least one case.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. (I, II) and (I, III) only.

Explanation: In a depth-first search (DFS) tree, a vertex v is visited postorder if all its descendants are visited first. Since u comes before v in the preorder traversal (pre(u) < pre(v)), it means that u must have been visited before v, and therefore u must be an ancestor of v in the DFS tree (Statement II is true).

As for Statement III, if w is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of u and v, and u is an ancestor of v, then u cannot be higher than w in the tree because the definition of LCA excludes children of w from being ancestors of both u and v. So, w cannot be any descendant of u, and since u is an ancestor, w must be u (Statement III is also true).

Therefore, the correct answer is D, II and III.

In a typical garbage collector, the root set includes:

A. Actual parameters of the active procedures: These are part of the roots because they are passed as arguments and can be accessed by the procedure's local variables.
C. Global variables of the program: These are also roots because they are accessible throughout the program's execution.
D. Local variables on the call stack: Since local variables are created and destroyed as procedures are called and return, their lifetimes are tied to the stack frame, making them part of the root set.

B. Dynamically allocated objects on the heap: These are not part of the root set because they are not necessarily reachable from the initial roots. The garbage collector will traverse the heap based on references held by the roots to identify reachable objects.

C. 11111111, 10000001
================================================================================================================================
A. 10,000 bytes/second

Explanation: The bandwidth of the network is 1,000 packets per second, and each packet is 1,000 bytes. Since the CPU time to send one packet is 10 milliseconds (0.01 seconds), the theoretical maximum data transfer rate is:

\( \frac{1,000 \text{ packets}}{1 \text{ second}} \times 1,000 \text{ bytes/packet} = 1,000,000 \text{ bytes/second} \)

However, we need to account for the CPU time, so the actual data transfer rate is:

\( 1,000,000 \text{ bytes/second} \times \frac{1 \text{ second}}{1000 \text{ ms}} = 10,000 \text{ bytes/second} \)

The grammar given is:
S → ( S ) // recursive self-referential rule
S → x // terminal symbol

Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous - False. Although the grammar has recursion, it is not inherently ambiguous because there is no clear way to resolve the ambiguity without additional context or a specific parsing strategy.

Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing - True. Recursive descent parsing, which is a top-down parsing technique, can handle this grammar because the start symbol S can initiate a recursive expansion based on the first rule.

Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing - True. This grammar can also be parsed using a bottom-up parser like a shift-reduce parser, as the second rule (S → x) allows for a simple reduction step.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. II and III only.
================================================================================================================================
C

Explanation: Hash tables provide constant-time average-case performance for inserting, deleting, and searching elements (problems B and D). They can also efficiently count distinct values by using a hash function to map keys to slots and keeping track of the count at each slot (problem A). However, for range search (problem C), a hash table does not inherently support efficient range queries, as it maps keys directly to locations and does not maintain any inherent order or range information. Other data structures like balanced search trees or range-indexed data structures would be more suitable for range search.

Write-through always writes to main memory immediately upon a write operation, even if the cache hit occurs. This means that any write operation leads to a main memory update. In contrast, write-back only updates main memory when the cache line is evicted, so not all write operations result in a main memory operation.

Therefore, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will always be larger for write-through than for write-back, assuming write-allocation is used. So, the correct answer is:

D. The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.

To calculate the percentage of occupied tracks, we need to convert the hexadecimal value to binary and count the number of 1s, which represent occupied tracks.

D4FE2003 in hexadecimal is:
- D4 = 11010100
- FE = 11111110
- 20 = 00101000
- 03 = 00000011

Combine them into one binary number:
11010100111111100010100000000011

Count the 1s:
11, 11, 10, 0, 1, 1 = 10 occupied bits

Total bits: 32

Percentage of occupied tracks = (number of occupied bits / total bits) * 100% = (10 / 32) * 100 ≈ 31.25%

Rounded to the nearest percent, the answer is 31%, which corresponds to option C. 38%. The other options are not accurate.

To represent 256 different values using ternary (base-3) logic, we need to find the smallest power of 3 that is greater than or equal to 256.

2^7 = 128
3^3 = 27

Since 256 is more than 128 but less than 27, we need at least 4 flits because 3 bits can represent 3^4 = 81 different values (0 to 2^3 - 1 for each flit), and the next power of 3 after 27 is 81.

Therefore, the answer is A. 4 flits.

We cannot determine the exact minimum average completion time without knowing the scheduling algorithm used. However, if we assume the shortest job first (SJF) or priority scheduling, the minimum completion time can be achieved by prioritizing the shortest job, which would be the 2-time unit job. After that, the next shortest job (3-time units) would be executed, and so on. In this case, the total time would be 2 + (2+15) + (2+15+5) + (2+15+5+3) = 92 time units.

So, the minimum average completion time would be 92 divided by the number of jobs, which is 5. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 92/5.

Explanation:
I. The problem of determining if a computation lasts for at least n steps is decidable because we can simulate the machine for n steps and check if it hasn't halted yet. If it has, the answer is yes; otherwise, no.

II. This problem is undecidable because it combines the halting problem (deciding if the computation ever halts) with a specific output condition. Since the halting problem is undecidable, we cannot decide if the machine will print a 1 after the nth step.

III. The problem of determining if M scans at least n distinct tape squares is decidable because we can simulate the machine and count the distinct tape squares visited up to the given limit. If the count reaches n or more, the answer is yes; otherwise, no.

Therefore, the decidable problems are I and III.

Increasing the clock cycle rate (I) directly reduces the execution time for all instructions, including those in a pipelined processor, since they complete in fewer cycles. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline (II) would actually hurt performance by preventing the reuse of partially completed instructions, leading to stalls. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and data cache (III) can reduce the number of cache misses, which can speed up execution time, especially for frequently accessed instructions.

Therefore, both I and III would improve the execution time of a typical program.
