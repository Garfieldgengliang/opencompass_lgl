The correct answer is D. Translation equivalence is not one of the three types of equivalence typically discussed in international market research. The three main types of equivalence are:

1. Conceptual equivalence: Ensuring that the meaning behind the questions and concepts being researched are the same across different cultures.
2. Market equivalence: Comparing the size, growth potential, and purchasing power of markets in different countries.
3. Functional equivalence: Ensuring that products or services have similar features, benefits, and user experiences across different markets.

Translation equivalence refers to the process of converting text from one language to another, which is a part of the research process but not an equivalence itself.

The store had 10 days (from August 4 to August 13) to take advantage of the 2% discount by paying within the first 10 days. Therefore, the payment calculation would be:

Invoice amount: $7,000
Discount: 2% of $7,000 = 0.02 * $7,000 = $140

Net amount to pay after discount: $7,000 - $140 = $6,860

So, the store paid $6,860.
