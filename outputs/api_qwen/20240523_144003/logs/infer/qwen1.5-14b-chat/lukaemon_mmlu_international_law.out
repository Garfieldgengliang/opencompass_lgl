International legal personality refers to the status of an entity under international law, granting it rights and duties, as well as the ability to engage in legal relationships and be held accountable for its actions. While States are the primary actors with international legal personality, other entities like international organizations may also acquire it to varying degrees, allowing them to participate in international law and exercise rights and responsibilities. Therefore, option B best captures the essence of international legal personality.

The statement "In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it wasn't examining enough cases" is false. The main reason for the reform discussions in the 1990s was indeed the increasing workload, backlog of cases, and the need to accommodate the expanding jurisdiction due to more member states, as indicated in option D. The other reasons mentioned in options B, C, and D were valid concerns at the time.

The principle of proportionality in international law generally refers to the requirement that the response of a State to a wrongful act (e.g., self-defense or countermeasures) should not be excessive in relation to the harm suffered. This means that the State may only use such means and force as are necessary to achieve their legitimate objective while minimizing unnecessary harm. Therefore, option C best reflects the meaning of proportionality in this context.

In the Osman v UK case, the European Court of Human Rights established a test for assessing whether a state has a general positive obligation to protect individuals from a real and imminent risk of harm, particularly in cases where the harm originates from state agents. The test includes the following elements:

A. The risk must emanate from a state agent
B. If there is a real and imminent risk (of death or harm)
C. A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death or harm occurring

Option D, "A state knows or ought to have known," is not a separate element of the Osman test but rather a consideration within the broader assessment of the state's knowledge or duty to act. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The killing committed by a Minister of a country while abroad, as a representative of their State, would generally be considered a public act (jure imperii) since it is performed in the name and on behalf of the State. Therefore, the answer is A. However, it is important to note that even public acts may be subject to exceptions or limitations when it comes to immunity from criminal prosecution, depending on the circumstances and applicable international law.
