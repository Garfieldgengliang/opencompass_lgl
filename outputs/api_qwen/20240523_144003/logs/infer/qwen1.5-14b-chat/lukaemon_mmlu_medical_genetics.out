Question: Which of the following statements about X-inactivation is FALSE?
A. Only one X chromosome is transcriptionally active (inactivated) in each female cell.
B. The process begins early in fetal development.
C. X-inactivation is random, so each cell may have a different inactive X chromosome.
D. The inactive X chromosome is degraded and no longer contributes to gene expression.
Answer: 

D

The inactive X chromosome is not degraded but rather transcriptionally silenced, so it still exists as a physical copy but its genes are not expressed. Therefore, the false statement is D.

An individual is most likely to share a common HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) haplotype with their identical twin, if they have one (which is the case for monozygotic twins). However, among the options given, a sister would be the next closest relative in terms of genetic similarity, as they inherit half of their HLA haplotypes from each parent, while parents and children share only 50% of their HLA haplotypes due to random assortment during meiosis. So, the correct answer is C. Sister.

Loss-of-function mutations, also known as null mutations, occur when a gene product is either completely absent or non-functional due to a change in its DNA sequence. Achondroplasia, a genetic disorder causing short stature and characteristic bone abnormalities, is primarily caused by a specific type of loss-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This mutation leads to reduced or impaired function of the protein, resulting in the characteristic phenotype. Therefore, the correct answer is D. loss-of-function.

Question: A genetic counselor:
A. can predict with certainty what a child will inherit from their parents.
B. is a healthcare professional who helps individuals and families understand the risks and options related to genetic disorders.
C. can cure genetic diseases.
D. is a scientist who conducts genetic research.
Answer: B

A genetic counselor is a healthcare professional who helps individuals and families understand the risks and options related to genetic disorders, rather than predicting with certainty what a child will inherit or curing genetic diseases. They do not conduct genetic research primarily, although they may use scientific knowledge in their work.
