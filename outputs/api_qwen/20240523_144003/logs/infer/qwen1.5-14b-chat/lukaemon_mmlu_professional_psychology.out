Explanation: The equity theory, developed by Adam Smith and later expanded by Robert M. Adams, suggests that people compare their inputs (efforts, skills, etc.) and outputs (rewards) with those of others in their social comparison group. If they perceive a lack of equity, or fairness, they may become dissatisfied and motivated to change their situation. In this case, if the wage and bonus incentives did not lead to increased motivation or satisfaction, it aligns with the idea that employees may still feel不公平 if their perceptions of equity are not met, despite the financial incentives.

The other options are not directly related to this issue:

A. ERG (Existence, Relatedness, Growth) theory focuses on basic human needs like existence, relationships, and growth, but doesn't specifically address financial incentives and their impact on motivation.

B. Expectancy theory deals with the relationship between effort, performance, and rewards, but the lack of increased motivation despite the incentives suggests that the employees' expectations for the outcome might not have been met.

D. Two-factor theory (Herzberg's hygiene theory) distinguishes between motivators (such as recognition and work itself) and hygiene factors (like company policy), but it doesn't predict that financial incentives alone won't affect motivation if employees perceive fairness.

C. 0.9

Item difficulty, typically denoted as p, refers to how well an item discriminates between individuals who perform well and those who perform poorly on a test. An item with a difficulty level close to 0.9 is considered very difficult, meaning it is mostly answered correctly by high-performing individuals and incorrectly by low-performing ones. This high discrimination contributes to effective differentiation between groups. Options A, B, and D would result in lower discrimination compared to option C.

The correct answer is D. Reinforcement on every trial (also known as continuous reinforcement) typically leads to the strongest and most resistant responses, as the organism is consistently rewarded for making the response, making it difficult for the response to extinguish over time. Partial reinforcement, where the response is reinforced only occasionally, promotes more variable responding and can make extinction easier to occur. Large magnitude reinforcement and mild punishment for failures may also affect the strength of the response, but not to the same extent as consistent reinforcement.

The left hemisphere is typically dominant for language and analytical tasks, so damage to it may affect reading, writing, and tasks involving comprehension. However, the process of elimination for multiple-choice questions relies more on lateralization, which is less strongly associated with the dominant hemisphere. Therefore, unilateral damage to the left hemisphere is least likely to result in an inability to use the process of elimination.

In this situation, you should forward a photocopy of the client's file to the requesting psychologist as long as you have received a signed release from the client authorizing the release of their information.

Sending a summary that includes only current conditions would not provide the full context needed for the psychologist's work. Options A, B, and D involve additional steps or restrictions that are not required by the release or standard practice.

Your colleague, as a licensed psychologist, has a professional responsibility to disclose any potential conflicts of interest or unethical behavior to you.

This allows you to assess the appropriateness of the actions and determine the next steps together, if necessary. Therefore, option C is the most ethical response in this scenario.

The CATHARSIS THEORY, proposed by Sigmund Freud, suggests that aggressive behavior can result from the expression of repressed aggressive impulses, which may temporarily relieve tension and reduce the likelihood of future aggressive acts. However, the theory is not supported by modern research, which has found that aggression is influenced by a complex interplay of psychological, social, and biological factors, and frustration is just one potential trigger, not a guaranteed cause of aggression. Therefore, the statement that aggression always results from frustration or that aggressive acts reduce the inclination to engage in further aggression is not consistently supported by empirical evidence. Option A is the closest to the CATHARSIS THEORY but is not necessarily true based on current research findings.

A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) usually offers greater protection against a Type I error because it evaluates the overall significance of multiple dependent variables simultaneously, reducing the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true due to the increased power from considering multiple variables together. This is in contrast to running separate univariate ANOVAs, which can increase the chances of committing a Type I error if there is a significant effect in one variable even though the overall pattern across variables is not significant.

MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is generally preferred over CT (Computed Tomography) for certain situations because it provides higher contrast and better soft tissue differentiation. Here's why:

A. Detection of a small tumor: MRI is often preferred for detecting small tumors because it can show detailed images of soft tissues and has better contrast resolution.

B. Detection of a skull fracture: CT is typically better for detecting skull fractures because it provides immediate, high-contrast images that clearly show bone structures, which is crucial in cases of head trauma.

C. Detection of acute cerebral infarct: MRI, particularly using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is preferred for detecting acute cerebral infarcts (strokes) as it can detect early signs of tissue damage before they appear on conventional CT scans.

D. Detection of white matter abnormalities: MRI, especially with sequences like T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery), is better suited for examining white matter, which is composed of nerve fibers and is not as well visualized on CT scans.

So, the correct answer is B. Skull fractures are more commonly detected using CT scans.

In systems theory, positive feedback is not a property that disrupts homeostasis; rather, it is a process where a small change in the system leads to a larger change that reinforces the initial perturbation, amplifying the effect and potentially destabilizing the system. Homeostasis, on the other hand, refers to the tendency of a system to maintain stability despite external changes. So, the incorrect definition among the options is:

D. POSITIVE FEEDBACK→ disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo

The correct understanding is that positive feedback reinforces homeostasis.

Operant extinction is a type of behavior modification where a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced, causing the behavior to decrease over time. It is effective when:

- An alternative behavior can be identified (A)
- Temporary increases in the behavior can be tolerated (C)
- Baseline levels of the behavior can be established (D)

However, if the behavior has been reinforced on a continuous schedule, it may still be reinforced even during extinction, making it less effective as the extinction process might be weakened. In such cases, a different approach like partial reinforcement or graduated extinction might be more suitable. Therefore, the answer is B.
