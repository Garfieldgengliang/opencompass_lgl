A production possibility frontier (PPF) is a graphical representation of all the combinations of two goods that can be produced by a given economy using its current resources efficiently. It is a straight line when the two goods are perfect substitutes in consumption, meaning that if more of one good is produced, less of the other can be produced without any loss in total utility. In such cases, any point on the line represents a constant marginal rate of substitution between the two goods.

An upward shift in the per unit price of labor, a variable input, causes an upward shift in the marginal cost (MC) curve because the firm now needs to pay more for each additional unit of labor, leading to higher total costs at every level of output. This does not affect average fixed costs (AFC), average variable costs (AVC), or marginal product of labor (MPL), which are not directly related to the price of labor.

Explanation: Price discrimination occurs when a seller charges different prices to different customers for the same product, based on their willingness to pay. In option B, both Bob and Nancy receive the same "$1 off" coupon, meaning they are being charged the same price after using the coupon. This situation does not involve price discrimination. The other options describe situations where different customers pay different prices due to factors like time of day, quantity purchased, or different pricing tiers.

A kinked demand curve typically occurs when there is a discontinuity in demand due to a change in market structure or a unique feature of the product. Kinked demand curves are most commonly associated with situations where there is a change in demand elasticity at a particular point, often due to a threshold effect or a change in the number of consumers (like a free gift making the demand temporarily more elastic). Interdependence of rivals (option C) is more commonly associated with oligopolies or strategic behavior among firms, rather than a characteristic of a kinked demand curve itself.

D. Air

Air is a necessity for human survival and is used extensively without any real alternative, so it provides a large total utility because people cannot go without it. However, the marginal utility of air decreases as more of it is consumed, since there is no limit to how much a person can breathe. This means that while the total utility is high, the marginal utility is relatively small. Other options like plastic, automobiles, and computers have diminishing marginal utility as people consume more of them.

An excise tax is a tax levied on the production or sale of goods, and the burden is typically shared between consumers and producers. When the demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers have no choice but to buy the product at the higher taxed price, so they bear the entire burden. On the other hand, if the supply curve is price elastic, an increase in tax leads to a greater reduction in quantity supplied, which partially offsets the tax burden for consumers.

Therefore, the combination of a perfectly inelastic demand curve (Option D) results in consumers paying the largest burden of the excise tax placed on the producer.

An economic rent refers to an above-average income or return that a person or firm receives due to factors beyond their control, such as a natural resource or a unique skill or location. In this case, a superstar basketball player's $50 million earnings are an example of economic rent because their talent and fame create a higher demand and thus a higher income, even if they face competition.

The other options typically involve transfers or income that are not considered rents because they are not due to a scarcity or unique advantage:

- Social security retirement income is earned through contributions and is not a pure economic rent.
- Welfare payments and college tuition checks from parents or guardians are more related to redistribution or financial support rather than economic rent based on market forces.

A price floor, which is a minimum legal price that a seller must charge for a product, can lead to a persistent shortage because it sets a price above the equilibrium price where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This forces producers to produce less than they would in a free market, creating a shortage as consumers want to buy more at the regulated price but cannot find it due to limited supply. This results in deadweight loss, as both consumers and producers are worse off than if the market were allowed to operate freely. So, the correct answer is A: a persistent shortage of the good.

D. lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages

In a perfectly competitive market, a firm is a price taker and cannot influence the market price. If a technological innovation raises the firm's marginal physical product (MFP), it increases the firm's productivity, allowing it to produce more output with the same input. Since the firm earns the same price for each unit sold (market price), an increase in MFP means the firm can sell more units at the same price, thus increasing its total revenue. To maximize profits, the firm will respond by hiring more workers to take advantage of the higher productivity, which in turn justifies paying them higher wages to keep them motivated.

A marginal social cost (MSC) represents the additional cost to society to produce one more unit of a good or service, including any externalities. Marginal private cost (MPC) is the cost to the individual producer for producing one more unit. When there's a negative externality, it means the producer does not bear the full cost of their actions on others. Therefore, the correct relationship is that the marginal social cost equals the marginal private cost plus the negative externality.

So the correct answer is:
D. Marginal social cost = marginal private cost + negative externality.

An increase in funding for education might lead to more teachers being hired, but it wouldn't directly decrease the demand for kindergarten teachers. Increased immigration could potentially increase the demand for teachers if more families need services, while subsidies for college students studying education might increase the supply of teachers. However, a decrease in the average number of children per household would lead to a reduced need for kindergarten teachers, as there would be fewer students enrolling. Therefore, the answer is C.

A sales tax is a type of tax that is levied on the purchase of goods and services. It is paid by the end consumer and is regressive because it tends to have a larger proportionate impact on lower-income individuals who spend a greater percentage of their income on essential goods and services subject to the tax. Higher-income earners can often spread the tax burden across a larger basket of goods, reducing its relative impact. Therefore, the correct answer is B. regressive tax.

In this situation, Elsa's opportunity cost (value of her time) is $50/hour, and she tutors David for 2 hours, so her total earnings from tutoring are $100 (2 hours * $50/hour). David is willing to pay $175, but they settle for $125.

Consumer surplus is the difference between what David is willing to pay and what he actually pays, which is $175 - $125 = $50.

Producer surplus is the difference between what Elsa earns ($125) and her opportunity cost ($100), which is $125 - $100 = $25.

The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $50 (consumer surplus) - $25 (producer surplus) = $25.

So, the correct answer is D. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.

In the short run, if the annual price of capital (a factor input) increases, the cost of using that capital will rise for the firm. This affects all short-run cost curves because capital is used in both fixed and variable costs. Therefore, the marginal cost (MC), average variable cost (AVC), average fixed cost (AFC), and average total cost (ATC) curves will all shift upward. So the correct answer is D.

In a perfectly competitive market, in the long run, firms cannot earn economic profits. Therefore, the price they receive must equal their minimum average total cost (ATC), which includes both fixed and variable costs. Since marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit, it is also equal to the price because the firm will produce where price equals marginal cost to maximize profit. This means that price = minimum average total cost (A) and price = marginal cost (D) are correct.

Minimum average variable cost (AVC) is a part of ATC and refers to the average cost of production when all fixed costs are sunk. In the long run, firms will adjust until MC = AVC as well, but this is a result of the first two conditions, not a separate requirement.

Therefore, the statement "price = minimum average variable cost" (C) is not necessarily correct for a perfectly competitive firm in the long run.

A normal good is one for which demand increases when consumers' income increases. This means that its demand curve has a positive income elasticity, indicating that as income rises, the quantity demanded of the good also rises, making it an elastic demand (since an increase in income leads to a greater than proportionate increase in demand). Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Question: If a monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, then the monopolist's marginal revenue curve
A. is always below the demand curve.
B. is always above the demand curve.

Answer: 
A
================================================================================================================================
A
================================================================================================================================
C

A competitive firm's demand for labor is determined by the marginal product of labor (MPL), which is the additional output the firm can produce by hiring one more worker, and the output price, since the firm wants to maximize profits by equating the marginal revenue (price times quantity) to the marginal cost. The opportunity cost of workers' time is also a factor, as it reflects the value of the next best alternative they could have chosen. So, the correct answer is C, as it combines both MPL and output price.

D

The demand curve for a monopoly is typically less elastic than for other market structures because monopolies have more control over the market and can influence price, leading to a less responsive demand due to the lack of close substitutes. Therefore, option D (monopoly firm's output) is the correct answer.

B. Increases         Indeterminate

The drought affects the supply of pineapples, leading to a decrease in supply, which would cause the equilibrium price to rise. The discovery that may assist in cancer prevention could potentially lead to a shift in consumer preferences away from pineapples towards other goods, but we don't have enough information to determine if this shift would be significant enough to change the equilibrium quantity. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity could either increase or decrease depending on the magnitude of the shift in preferences, making it indeterminate.

Monopolistic competition in the long run typically leads to a situation where firms achieve a level of minimum average total cost (ATC) at which they can produce at a profit, but not necessarily zero economic profits. This means that firms will continue producing as long as their price is above their average total cost, but not necessarily where marginal cost equals zero, which is a characteristic of perfect competition.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
D. Minimum average total cost equals price.

C

The student would not eat the fourth slice because the marginal utility of the third slice is already lower than 0 (3 utils), indicating that the decrease in satisfaction from each additional slice is negative. So, stopping after the second slice would have resulted in a higher total utility since the first two slices had positive marginal utilities. There is no information provided about the total utility, only the marginal utilities of the slices consumed.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.
